And they’ve asked how much the other company is offering? You can say anything that you want “They offered me a zillion skillion dollars”. If money is the only reason to leave or to stay, you should tell your current company what it will take, salary-wise, to make you stay.

In fact, you are going to soon find yourself too exhausted to do anywhere near as much going out as you did in college. You do not stay up late, roll out of bed, put on a ballcap, and go to work. Your grooming matters. The money you make will make you feel very rich. But you need to keep living small. Student loans need to be paid back. If you can stay with roommates in a house. Save a ton of money. Work is not a course or term paper. You do not get a new start in 18 weeks and you do not get to turn in your work, have your professor tell you what you did wrong, and try it again. You need to learn how to get things right the first time each time. While she never went to college I had a woman worked for me did not grasp this. Her numbers were often wrong, I finally had to fire her but did tell her that I was not a teacher correcting homework. Accept that you do not get a ton of time off.

I bet you can knock out at least three or four of these right now—yes, even from your phone. Don’t wait like I did. 1. Cancel Your Car Insurance You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix. Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called Insurify shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year. If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you. Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and see how much you could save on car insurance. 2. Ask This Company to Get a Big Chunk of Your Debt Forgiven A company called National Debt Relief could convince your lenders to simply get rid of a big chunk of what you owe. No bankruptcy, no loans — you don’t even need to have good credit. If you owe at least $10,000 in unsecured debt (credit card debt, personal loans, medical bills, etc.), National Debt Relief’s experts will build you a monthly payment plan. As your payments add up, they negotiate with your creditors to reduce the amount you owe. You then pay off the rest in a lump sum. On average, you could become debt-free within 24 to 48 months. It takes less than a minute to sign up and see how much debt you could get rid of. 3. You Can Become a Real Estate Investor for as Little as $10 Take a look at some of the world’s wealthiest people. What do they have in common? Many invest in large private real estate deals. And here’s the thing: There’s no reason you can’t, too — for as little as $10. An investment called the Fundrise Flagship Fund lets you get started in the world of real estate by giving you access to a low-cost, diversified portfolio of private real estate. The best part? You don’t have to be the landlord. The Flagship Fund does all the heavy lifting. With an initial investment as low as $10, your money will be invested in the Fund, which already owns more than $1 billion worth of real estate around the country, from apartment complexes to the thriving housing rental market to larger last-mile e-commerce logistics centers. Want to invest more? Many investors choose to invest $1,000 or more. This is a Fund that can fit any type of investor’s needs. Once invested, you can track your performance from your phone and watch as properties are acquired, improved, and operated. As properties generate cash flow, you could earn money through quarterly dividend payments. And over time, you could earn money off the potential appreciation of the properties. So if you want to get started in the world of real-estate investing, it takes just a few minutes to sign up and create an account with the Fundrise Flagship Fund. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Real Estate Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund’s prospectus.

      "Question: Is technical interview question from a company easier than its coding challenge?\n",
      "True Answer: It depends on the company. More importantly, it depends on your strengths and preferences as a candidate. Do you prefer a take-home, open-book test or an in-class, closed-book test? A coding challenge is usually a take-home assignment. You get to work in your own home, with your own development environment, access to online resources, and with loose time constraints. But you’re likely to spend at least several hours on the coding challenge A technical interview occurs under tight time constraints, either on-site or remotely over a videoconference.

Do you prefer a take-home, open-book test or an in-class, closed-book test? A coding challenge is usually a take-home assignment. You get to work in your own home, with your own development environment, access to online resources, and with loose time constraints. But you’re likely to spend at least several hours on the coding challenge A technical interview occurs under tight time constraints, either on-site or remotely over a videoconference. An individual interview is unlikely to last more than an hour — though you might have several in a row as part of a full-day, on-site interview. A technical interview typically a mix of talking about your past work, interactive problem solving, and coding. But you usually write code in a environment you’d never use for real development, e.g., CoderPad or a whiteboard. Which is easier? It really depends. If you do well under pressure, then an onsite interview may require less work, and you’re unlikely to have to go into much depth. On the other hand, you may prefer a take-home coding challenge as an opportunity to do more work at your own pace. As a hiring manager, I’d say that the coding challenge is probably a more accurate way to assess a candidate’s coding ability than a technical interview. But it also requires significantly more time investment on the part of the candidate, which introduces the risk of biasing the candidate pool towards people who have more time or lack other compelling opportunities. When possible, I’ve offered candidates the opportunity to demonstrate their coding ability in a variety of ways, letting them pick one that plays to their strengths and preferences — as long as it provides the signal I need to assess them.\n",

      "User question: Is technical interview question from a company easier than its coding challenge?\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Assistant: Technical interview questions typically focus on understanding the candidate's problem-solving skills, logical reasoning, and critical thinking abilities. These types of questions can be challenging for candidates who struggle with abstract concepts or have limited experience with complex programming languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, coding challenges often require candidates to demonstrate their knowledge of specific programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and coding techniques. While these challenges may also test the candidate's ability to think critically, they are more focused on application rather than theoretical concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while technical interview questions can be more challenging due to their focus on applying knowledge and solving problems within a particular context, coding challenges can also be highly beneficial as they require candidates to apply their knowledge directly to a real-world scenario. Ultimately, both types of questions can help assess a candidate's overall skills and fit for a role, making it important for companies to consider both types when selecting potential hires.\n",

My Husband was very weak in quants but now he is so confident you can ask him anything. Deepak sir nurture the students from very basics. He also provide technical knowledge like Python and Data Science. He is really good if you want a personal mentor then go with him. Or if you want just video then go with YouTube. Lectures are very well designed for working professional and easy to understand. Weekly test make course easier to pass the exam. One to one doubt solving and personalised attention with proper planning and scheduling is like a blessing. Best part is that you can ring him anytime of the day. You can check one video of one of our batchmate passed CFA exam in 50 days time. Testimony is given by her father himself. People at that age don't give false testimony. So you can trust this review and video. Hopefully i will get same meeting with Deepak sir soon.\n",

      "Assistant: Yes, it is generally considered unwise or frowned upon to constantly switch jobs within your industry. This practice is often seen as a lack of commitment and loyalty to your current employer, which may reflect poorly on you when seeking future opportunities. Additionally, frequent job changes could negatively impact your career progression and limit your ability to build valuable experience across different roles and companies. If you have already made such a decision, there are several ways to mitigate any negative consequences, including building strong relationships with your colleagues, maintaining a positive reputation, and focusing on developing transferable skills that can be applied across various roles.\n",

Your employer wants maximum productivity for the least amount of money. They will gladly accept you working yourself to death for the same salary you’ve always been earning. I work 40 hours per week. I give accurate estimates, as accurate as an engineer can. I’ve never seen a project come in late due specifically to developer-related issues. A deadline might slip by a day or two because of developer issues or emergencies, but when a project suffers from so much scope creep or poorly defined requirements that the slippage is counted in months, that’s not a developer issue. That’s an upstream issue, a team leadership issue, and/or a management issue. And I won’t allow my family to suffer (nor put myself in an early grave) due to poor management. Learn to say “No.”\n",

      "True Answer: As a product manager I learned that it is not possible to do everything yourself. You need to rely on others. But most importantly, you need to learn how to delegate, or you will find yourself doing all the work or worse, assigning tasks to people that do not have the necessary skills.I had a team of four people that helped me with various tasks regarding production processes.

You need to rely on others. But most importantly, you need to learn how to delegate, or you will find yourself doing all the work or worse, assigning tasks to people that do not have the necessary skills.I had a team of four people that helped me with various tasks regarding production processes. At least that is how it was supposed to be. When I started this position, I found myself swamped with work every day. Everybody would leave the office at 5pm sharp and I was the only one staying until eight. The next day was a rinse and repeat from the previous one. I was having problems understanding why this situation kept happening. I was feeling burnt out by the end of my first month. I seriously considered quitting. One day, a member of my team came into my office to drop some documents, telling me that this was what I requested. I looked at her because I remembered telling her I needed a copy of it, then the original had to be archived again. She left my office and I stayed there, just holding the documents in my hand. Then it dawned on me. I was doing all the work, I was so worried about the quality of the work that I had decided, unconsciously, that I needed to do it to make certain that it had no errors (I know that is not possible, but my insecurities had taken a hold of me) that could get me into trouble. That night, I went into my old college notes on management and found that part about delegating tasks. It is important to take advantage of the strengths of your team, you should know their strengths and weaknesses, you should map out the skills and abilities of each member so you know you can trust someone with part of the job because you know they will come through. So, let me tell you the five changes I made in my management style that allowed me to learn that skill of delegating work effectively, as a product manager. 1. Map out all processes that happen in your department It is important to have a visual tool to check out all the processes that your department has, as well as those that your department is a part of. You need to have a big picture idea of what is going on in your area, even if it is small. Then, you need to document that. But I think it is more useful to involve your team in this exercise, they know all the processes and those little details of what needs to happen to deliver on time and within budget. Make someone responsible for mapping out all the processes, with the help of the rest of the team, and ask that person to document all processes. Then, you can sit down and discuss areas of opportunity. 2. Talk to each member of your team and ask them what they do daily This is very important, especially if you are the new boss. This conversation may help them navigate the uncertainty of new management, it will put them at ease. Don’t make this into a review meeting, ask questions about processes, not about their performance. This meeting will help you assess what their experiences are, what they know about their part of the job, and how they can help you achieve your goals. You need to document what they tell you so you can build that big picture. At the end, sit down on your own and start analyzing the data. Here you can find what each member of your team can do for you, how they can help, their strengths and their weaknesses. 3. Try to find a second in command If you bring somebody with you to help you (I didn’t, I had to find one), they can be your second in command. Otherwise, find one within your new team. Of course, trust will take some time to develop but work with them towards building a way of working where you can delegate managerial tasks that you don’t need to do. This person will help you with the ideas you want to implement, they should work with you in tuning up the process to achieve your goals. If you find that person objecting to a lot of your ideas, then you may need to find somebody else. 4. Divide the tasks among the team Once the processes are documented, divide the tasks among your team, considering their strengths and weaknesses. If you have an expert on metallurgy, don’t place that person in charge of desk tasks, that person should be on the floor or in the testing labs. This is just an example, but keep in mind that this division must be comparable to their position level, meaning that you can’t assign managerial tasks to the guy in charge of making the copies. You need to be fair. But you also need to give room for improvement, if somebody is having problems, evaluate the best strategy to switch tasks and give that person some other tasks they can perform. The reason that lady handed me that original report is that I did not specify clearly what I needed, you need to be as specific as possible but give them some room for autonomy, you need to empower them. 5. Don’t micromanage So, this is what I was doing when I began as a product manager for a manufacturing company, like I mentioned before. You can supervise but you don’t need to make daily rounds to check if they are doing the job. This is the reason you need to set delivery times. You need them to commit to their deliveries. When you do the division of tasks, you also need to establish the deliveries. If you ask somebody to do something for you, specify exactly the goal and how long you expect this to be completed. Your second in command must be the one doing the rounds, checking that everybody is on task. You need to trust that all of them will get on board with your project. You will see those who don’t agree, and you can replace them, if that is the case. Finally, I would like to establish that this was a very long process, and it was not easy. I learned a lot during this experience, and I am grateful I had the opportunity to work with that team. When I left, the operation was running smoothly, we were on time and did not have to expand our budget. In terms of personal relations, even though I treated all my workers with the uttermost respect, I was not sure if they liked me. But, at the end, they threw a goodbye party for me, which I was not expecting. That is how I realized I had made an impact on this team. So, the best skill you can learn as a product manager is to delegate responsibilities and tasks to the right people. Make goals and deliverables clear, make them commit to these, taking into account their strengths and weaknesses. In this latter, maybe you can offer to help them overcome this through training or mentoring. But don’t think you can do everything on your own, that is, as I learned, rather silly.\n",

Nearly all my peers my age have long transitioned into engineering management. As such, I think I have a good handle on why so many leave IC to become managers. There are a variety of reasons.It is harder to become a very senior IC than an EM. As ICs advance in rank, they are not only expected to contribute company-wide impact, they are also expected to contribute industry-wide impact. It is difficult to achieve this without being a honest-to-goodness expert in one or more fields. Achieving this requires a tremendous amount of self-study and passion for the subject matter.Scaling influence gets more difficult. Suppose you have achieved (1) and are now a world-class expert in some field. Your company is starting a project in your field that will span many teams. You can easily come up a design that will work on Day 1 and scales out to a billion users. But… although that’s the part that leverages expertise, it is not the hard part. How do you convince people that your design is right? For one thing, guarantee, there will be somebody or somebodies who can make the same promises with 1/4 the headcount. Scaling influence requires communication savvy and political skills… which also just happens to lean into the traits that make up good EMs.Companies don’t support the IC path. In theory, many top-notch companies now have abandoned the Peter Principle and now consider the technical IC track to be fully parallel and equivalent to the managerial track. In reality, even in companies where this track receives good support, people internally tend to discriminate against ICs for a variety of reasons which makes it difficult to exert influence.People don’t know what they don’t know. This is somewhat related to #2. One example of this happening: at a prior company I worked in, I designed an ad tracking system that would scale out and required only 15 or so HTTP servers with geographical redundancy and spiky load support. I knew my math was right. However, when I put the homebrew HTTP server on top of it, the HTTP rate was limited to 100–400 QPS. I was shocked. I did some investigation and TL;DR - found the company was wasting upward of 75MM an year with this unsalable HTTP library where there were some fleets of 500 servers accepting only 7 requests a second on average — somehow nobody ever questioned this. I raised the alarm, and got pushback from networking engineers (in the form of “your numbers are wrong, we support up to 800 requests a second”). But I stood my ground, proved that 20K or so HTTP requests a second is a much better target to achieve, and we rolled out the original design with 15 HTTP servers on a rewritten library. The point being - there are many engineers who have a certain kind of hubris that makes it difficult for them to accept that they are not yet experts, and it’s hard for an aspiring IC to succeed in this kind of environment without having skin a foot thick.There are more reasons, but I’d list all of these the most important reasons for why I stay awake at 3 AM wondering why I didn’t go down management. But ultimately, knowledge is my passion, and the IC path allows me to pursue that more freely.\n",

The outcome of one interview will not make or break your life. Always remember that. Each ‘failure’ is an opportunity. Of course, if you keep ‘failing’ without improving, you’re wasting time.

Maximize each interview by taking notes, reviewing, researching, and improving your answers for the next time. This both turns it into a learning experience, and takes some of the pressure off of the interview. Fear of judgment is a little harder. The interview is an assessment. There’s no sugar-coating that reality. But, it’s an assessment on both sides. Shoulder some of the responsibility of that assessment by thinking of you and the interviewer as partners in deciding whether it’s a good fit. This can really help in reframing the interview in your own mind, and eliminating some of that nervousness. The outcome, decided by either you or the interviewer, may be that it’s not a good fit. There are really only two interpretations of this (that matter): you’re better off in a different company or role, or, you’re not ready yet and so you learn, grow, and get ready for the next time.\n",

I also worked on scalable systems as a software engineer for 8+ years. System Design has become a standard technical interview topic at most tech companies. That means the sooner you start to develop a working knowledge of System Design, the better. At face value, a big challenge to the System Design interview is that most interviewees don't have experience building large-scale systems. As a new grad, you are probably feeling this pressure. But here is the thing to remember: most interviewers aren't looking for applied System Design experience. Rather, they are looking for a working knowledge of modern System Design fundamentals. I wrote a blog called How to prepare for the system design interview, which is a good place to start. In this article, I cover:Distributed system fundamentalsArchitecture of large-scale web applicationsDesigning distributed systemsThe only way to succeed in the SDI is by internalizing System Design fundamentals. It’s not as simple as just drilling practice questions (as an interviewer I can always tell when a candidate took this approach). What I really want is to understand your thought process when I ask you how to design a complex, large-scale system. You should outline the requirements, scope, and constraints before suggesting a solution. Then be prepared to have a discussion about which tradeoffs you need to make, and why. Again, in order to do all of this fluently, you need to familiarize yourself with the building blocks of modern System Design. If you are ready to go in-depth, I highly recommend the recent course from the team at Educative: Grokking Modern System Design for Engineers and Managers. It provides comprehensive coverage of modern System Design, from the fundamentals to their use in real-world applications. It teaches best practices and design principles of large-scale distributed systems that have revolutionized our modern software landscape and stood the test of time.﻿ A lot of work and validation went into creating this course, in order to make it the best and most up-to-date resource it can possibly be.

      "True Answer: I remember being younger, like 15 or so, and the dating advice all the 18–19 year olds would give the kids my age was “don’t even try.” Like, somehow trying to get a significant other was somehow harmful? WTF is that? But, as most adults know, they were right, just incomplete. The full answer should’ve been something like,Don’t have the goal of having just somebody, but rather invest in yourself. Be okay with yourself, who you are, what you love, and don’t compromise that for anything. Then go out and meet tons of people with the goal of finding out if they compliment who you are.WTF does this Continue ReadingI remember being younger, like 15 or so, and the dating advice all the 18–19 year olds would give the kids my age was “don’t even try.” Like, somehow trying to get a significant other was somehow harmful? WTF is that? But, as most adults know, they were right, just incomplete. The full answer should’ve been something like,Don’t have the goal of having just somebody, but rather invest in yourself. Be okay with yourself, who you are, what you love, and don’t compromise that for anything. Then go out and meet tons of people with the goal of finding out if they compliment who you are.WTF does this have to do with engineering!? Right! A point to all this wordiness, I almost forgot. Well, it’s exactly the same thing. When people go into software engineering and try to have a checklist that says “own project, implement unit tests, contribute to architectural piece, collaborate on cross-team project, then I will be SDE2, huzzah!” It actually doesn’t work. Worse still, when that fails to work, it destroys morale. No option to work cross-team, maybe you did do all those things, but you’re still not technically up to par. Maybe you’re a super badass coder, but you suck at giving/taking feedback, who knows. Start with yourself, and don’t even try to get promoted. This is where it ties back together. Try to write the cleanest code, avoid bugs, help everyone you can, as often as you can, read about leadership and ownership, experiment with new ideas and ask questions, etc. Find a mentor, or just find someone you really respect and want to emulate. Ask them questions, get over that fear of looking stupid and figure out why they do what they do. All that stuff. The fastest way to level up is humility, diligence, and truly investing in yourself and your team, not for the purpose of seeking promotion, but for the purpose of bettering yourself and those around you for the sake of doing so.\n",

Technical interviews often involve complex algorithms, data structures, and programming concepts that may not be as easily demonstrated through coding challenges. However, it's important to note that all companies have different requirements for their technical interviews, so some coding challenges may still be considered \"technical\" by certain standards.

However, if you're comfortable working independently and don't mind spending time by yourself, then there should be no problem at all.\n",

Computer programming - no, those A.I.s aren’t going to program themselves (not without human help, anyway). All forms of scientific research will still be done by humans.

Computer programming - no, those A.I.s aren’t going to program themselves (not without human help, anyway). All forms of scientific research will still be done by humans. Yes, someone made a machine that can perform simple chemical experiments, and there will probably be many others in 3 decades, but 99% of all research will still be done by human beings. Most trades - plumbing, electrical, most construction jobs, etc. aren’t going to be done by robots, at least not in 30 years. Hair-dressers/ barbers, masseurs, etc., too. Humans will continue to be more adaptable, more reliable and cheaper. Doctors, nurses and other medical staff will have A.I and robot assistants, but still be done by people. Maybe in 100 years the robots will take over, but probably not even then - more like 150 to 200 years. Entertainment and sports, obviously - although CGI will blur the lines a lot, it will still be cheaper to hire real people. That includes actors on TV/ streaming services, newsreaders and all of the people in the background who don’t show up on screen. Teaching, marketing, management and other jobs will also remain - again, they will have plenty of computer/ A.I. assistance programs, but the actual work will be done by human beings. Lawyers and police will still be done by humans in 30 years - although the investigation tools will be better. Careers in farming and fishing will have better tools to make them more efficient (A.I driven tractors may be a thing in 30 years) but will still need a human to tell the robots what to do and to make sure the work is done properly. There will still be chefs/ cooks and waitstaff - although more restaurants will have the customer input orders through a kiosk or electronic menu. A list of jobs that COULD be replaced would probably be shorter.\n",

      "Assistant answer: It is difficult for AI to replace certain tasks or work in the future due to factors such as human interaction, creativity, and emotional intelligence. Some examples of such jobs include:\n",
      "- Creative writing or content creation - Even though AI can generate text, its capability is limited compared to human creativity.\n",
      "- Human-computer interface development - This includes designing interfaces for computers and communication with users, which requires empathy and understanding of human needs.\n",
      "- Medical diagnosis - AI may perform complex medical analyses but cannot replace human doctors' expertise and empathy in diagnosing patients.\n",
      "- Artistic expression - While AI can produce art, it lacks the emotional connection and subjective interpretation that humans bring to their creations.\n",
      "- Customer service - Although AI can handle simple customer queries, it lacks the ability to understand emotions or nuances in conversations that require human intervention.\n",

If you are a techie and you work for tech companies, then you just become a sheep among tens of thousands of cattle coders who get a wet dream about working in Big Tech every night. But working in a tech company or even IT services company is no cakewalk. It is like tossing your work life balance out the window. And always carrying that resignation letter in pocket. Never know when you get a rating of 2.5 followed by a pink slip. And tremendous/dirty politics with 100s of fellow techies vying for one coveted programming opportunity or one promotion.On the other hand Non-Tech companies (Paper, cement, Sales marketing & advertizing, Retail, real Estate, Hospitality, Entertainment and Hospitals etc) are not tech savvy. They are ambitious, they are aspirational, but they lack Technology depth because remember the Cattle Coders went to Tech companies to become a Coolie there ? So, the non tech companies desperately seek Technology talent. Apply for a mid sized Non-Tech Company. Tell them I will build everything from scratch. Give them direction. In a non tech company, even small things matter like setting up their Communication Channels like MS 365, Outlook, Google drive. Streamlining their processes and giving them a digital identity by setting up their website and app and blog and setting up their digital transformation, CRM system on Cloud. Once they see your talent, they will put you on highest pedestal. Every department and employee will see you as Messiah. You will be the defacto Lord for them. Becoming a messiah is 100X better than being a coolie in saturated Big Tech companies and IT firms like Accenture, Infosys and TCS of the world.\n",

      "Yes, it is possible that AI will reduce the demand for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Engineers in some areas as technology advances. However, this could also lead to an increase in demand for skills related to data analysis and analytics. It ultimately depends on how quickly AI technologies develop and evolve, which is outside my control as an AI model.\n",

      "\n",
      "To help you better understand the future implications of AI and its impact on the workforce, here are some factors to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Rapid advancements in AI technology: With every passing year, AI systems become more sophisticated and powerful. As these advancements continue, they may make it easier for non-technical roles such as data analysts, data scientists, and business intelligence specialists to compete with AI professionals.\n",
      "2. Increased automation: As machines and robots automate more tasks, the demand for human workers who specialize in human-computer interaction may decline.\n",
      "3. Skilled technical workers needed: Despite any potential reduction in the demand for specific roles, there will always be a need for skilled technical workers who can work with AI technology. These positions require specialized knowledge and experience in areas like programming, data engineering, machine learning, and AI development.\n",
      "4. Collaboration between different fields: The intersection of AI, data science, and other fields has created new opportunities for collaboration and interdisciplinary skill sets. For instance, an AI engineer might collaborate with data scientists to design and train models or work alongside software developers to build and maintain AI-powered systems.\n",
      "5. Upskilling and retraining programs: To keep up with the rapidly changing technological landscape, many companies offer training programs to employees seeking to upskill their existing skills or learn new ones. This trend towards continuous learning and upskilling suggests that there will be ongoing demand for skilled technical workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while AI is expected to continue shaping the job market, there will likely remain a demand for skilled technical workers across various roles, including those working with AI technology. Therefore, pursuing a career in Computer Science and becoming an AI Engineer may still be a viable option in the long run, though it may take additional skills and expertise to remain competitive in the evolving job market.\n",

Good programmers are good programmers because they've found and mastered an area of the discipline they particularly love. Mastering any one area of programming is ridiculously hard work, requiring a depth of understanding that most would find tiresome to learn and the people that do it are only good programmers if they then push that knowledge into new places to make things more efficient or solve a problem nobody considered or everyone believed to be insurmountable. Only programmers that love their work have what it takes and predicting what area you're going to love most is especially difficult when you've yet to taste much of what there is out there on offer. With that in mind, use the answers you gather here just to get you started and then every step along the way, when you find something that interests you to discover more about or push a little further, don't be afraid to take a potentially permanent diversion. To get you started, you first must appreciate there are many languages and subareas in programming. Most people end up working with the a language from the C family or Java as these are the most popular across the world. They are most popular because they are extremely powerful, general tools and there exists a library for almost any purpose imaginable. C++ and Java are the two most popular examples of object-oriented languages. These languages are the most versatile and Python is establishing itself as another great offering in this direction, boasting some intuitive features the others missed and have developed too far to efficiently work in. Java is also notable for running on a virtual machine. This means your Java code can run on any machine that has a version of the JVM, which is a useful feature but makes the language slower. Most people won't notice because it is fast enough for most purposes. C is not object-oriented but it is perhaps the fastest 'high level' language out there being very close to the hardware with minimal abstraction. Other higher level languages (more abstractions from hardware) tend to be built on top of C. Going further down than C there is Assembly code. This is the closest you get to hardware before writing directly in binary. Assembly programming is slow and laborious but it provides you with the fastest code. The majority of people are satisfied with the assembly code their compiler generates or hire a programmer with assembly experience just for the small amounts of code that need to run that little bit faster or else are rendered impractical. Assembly not fast enough for you? Well you could learn hardware and/or work with a hardware description language like VHDL. These languages are useful for generating hardware designed to perform just one task (or a few) really well and produce the plans for the hardware that goes into specialised electronics. If speed is not your greatest concern, you could instead go in the direction of other specialised languages/areas: Web programming is quite popular but not being a particular interest of mine I'm not the best to tell you about its offerings.HTML is not a real language but it may be helpful to know the basics. CSS is gaining popularity but isn't a universal thing just yet and the field is yet to settle; it also exists only really to describe how pages should be laid out. PHP is a far more general web programming language but I believe JavaScript is considered the simplest and best place to begin if you're just after a taste of things.Web programming is split into client and server side areas of interests with the deepest and most technical side being the server which aims to keep things as simple for the client as possible whilst doing the least work it has to so it may serve many users quickly. Logic programming is another specialised area which probably has its biggest focus right now in artificial intelligence though it also looks at topics such as multi-agent systems theorem proving etc. It is a natural direction to go in if you've studied logic and found that to be your greatest interest but it's mostly used only in academic circles. Prolog is a fun and simple language to play around with but you'll quickly discover its limitations for general programming. Nevertheless, its backtracking capability, flexible functions, and ability to rewrite itself at runtime make it quite fun to use and a great choice for any compatible problem type. If artificial intelligence is an interest then you're more likely to want to look at machine learning and one of the more powerful, general languages discussed earlier. You may also need to develop your maths further to get to grips with a lot of its algorithms. MATLAB is an extremely powerful (if a little slow) a language for anything requiring matrices (or vectors or multidimensional tables etc.). This makes it good for Computer Vision, Neural Networks, statistics, big data analysis etc. Graphics also tend to be matrix based but this language is probably far too slow for that. If data analysis or graphics are an interest, consider looking at R; it is a fun, simple, powerful language that practically everybody who uses it loves. Functional programming concerns itself with problems that take in a set of various alphanumeric inputs and produce one output. If your problems of interest match this class, you're in for a treat as these languages are some of the most simple, intuitive, and fun to work with. Haskell is a brilliant example. In terms of hireabilty, functional programmers do well in banking and I suspect there are good opportunities in consultancy. This list is inexhaustive of the options and greatest languages out there to work with but hopefully will help you discover where you want to go searching first. In terms of books, I make no suggestions. You're probably better off asking a separate question for that but really no book is a substitute for just picking up a language and playing around with it. There are many good resources online too to help you learn but the best way I know of learning is doing; simply continuously set yourself tasks that are just a little beyond your current capabilities and get to solving them! Books and other resources exist just for turning to when you get a little stuck; you get past your hurdle and move on. Teach yourself as you go and try to do a little bit of programming every day (new code, not just code maintainance) so you never put it down for too long and lose your progress. Good programmers think and dream in code...\n",

Prioritization: From this distillation of information, it’s a product manager’s responsibility to help prioritize products or features that their team should be focusing on as well as convincing their team and upper management to get on board with the vision that they’ve laid out based on their analysis and prioritization. A product manager must also work with the rest of the team to lay out an actionable plan to execute these proposed ideas. Execution: Once it comes time for the team to start building the product, a product manager must ensure that details are taken care of, edge cases are accounted for, and make sure the product is tested and ready to ship on time. And once the product is finally shipped, the job isn’t done. A product manager needs to determine success of the product through an understanding of how customers interact with the product. This feedback gives a product manager even more context and data to adjust future iterations of the product as well as help better plan ongoing roadmap plans and product ideas.

The really bad version is “the candidate is White or Asian male in his early twenties, and so am/was I, so I kind of feel a personal connection”.

Let me start with the bad one. The bad one is “this person is kind of like me”. The really bad version is “the candidate is White or Asian male in his early twenties, and so am/was I, so I kind of feel a personal connection”. This usually happens subconsciously, because most people don’t intend to be racist/sexist/whatever and to violate the law, but they can’t help finding it easier to connect with someone like that. A better, but still bad version, is the one I can confess to. I came across a candidate at Google and he, like me, started coding as a little kid, and he did math and coding olympiads like me, and he is just a typical computer geek with thick glasses and low social skills, you know, like me. So naturally I liked him. And he is like many people at Google in terms of his background. I actually don’t remember or cared what racial or other category he was, it was all about his interests. And then I realized that this was also bad, because that’s not what I am supposed to judge him on. So in my feedback I wrote this, “I think X would be a great fit for Google, but I think I am biased because he is so much like me”. And I left it to the hiring committee to sort this out. Google makes it explicit that you are not supposed to use the above approach. So what’s a good version? It should be based entirely on the interview. If you talk to a candidate, and he treats you as a colleague, with neither undue deference, nor condescension, that’s Googley. If he is excited to solve a problem because it’s really cool, that’s Googley. If he tells you about his excitement about working at Google in a genuine way, that’s Googley. If he can demonstrate to you that he has genuine ethical values, that’s Googley. In short, if the candidate’s behavior shows that he is someone you want to work with, that’s what Googley is supposed to be about.\n",

They’ve helped so many people save hundreds, secure their family’s future, and grow their bank accounts—myself included. And honestly? Putting them to use was way easier than I expected. I bet you can knock out at least three or four of these right now—yes, even from your phone. Don’t wait like I did. 1. Cancel Your Car Insurance You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix. Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called Insurify shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year. If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you. Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and see how much you could save on car insurance. 2. Ask This Company to Get a Big Chunk of Your Debt Forgiven A company called National Debt Relief could convince your lenders to simply get rid of a big chunk of what you owe. No bankruptcy, no loans — you don’t even need to have good credit. If you owe at least $10,000 in unsecured debt (credit card debt, personal loans, medical bills, etc.), National Debt Relief’s experts will build you a monthly payment plan. As your payments add up, they negotiate with your creditors to reduce the amount you owe. You then pay off the rest in a lump sum. On average, you could become debt-free within 24 to 48 months. It takes less than a minute to sign up and see how much debt you could get rid of. 3. You Can Become a Real Estate Investor for as Little as $10 Take a look at some of the world’s wealthiest people. What do they have in common? Many invest in large private real estate deals. And here’s the thing: There’s no reason you can’t, too — for as little as $10. An investment called the Fundrise Flagship Fund lets you get started in the world of real estate by giving you access to a low-cost, diversified portfolio of private real estate. The best part? You don’t have to be the landlord. The Flagship Fund does all the heavy lifting. With an initial investment as low as $10, your money will be invested in the Fund, which already owns more than $1 billion worth of real estate around the country, from apartment complexes to the thriving housing rental market to larger last-mile e-commerce logistics centers. Want to invest more? Many investors choose to invest $1,000 or more. This is a Fund that can fit any type of investor’s needs. Once invested, you can track your performance from your phone and watch as properties are acquired, improved, and operated. As properties generate cash flow, you could earn money through quarterly dividend payments. And over time, you could earn money off the potential appreciation of the properties. So if you want to get started in the world of real-estate investing, it takes just a few minutes to sign up and create an account with the Fundrise Flagship Fund. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Real Estate Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund’s prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. 4. Get Up to $50,000 From This Company Need a little extra cash to pay off credit card debt, remodel your house or to buy a big purchase? We found a company willing to help. Here’s how it works: If your credit score is at least 620, AmONE can help you borrow up to $50,000 (no collateral needed) with fixed rates starting at 6.40% and terms from 6 to 144 months. AmONE won’t make you stand in line or call a bank. And if you’re worried you won’t qualify, it’s free to check online. It takes just two minutes, and it could save you thousands of dollars. Totally worth it. 5. Grow Your Money 10x Faster With This Online Bank Account If you bank at a traditional brick-and-mortar bank, your money probably isn’t growing much (c’mon, 0.40% is basically nothing). But there’s good news: With SoFi Checking and Savings (member FDIC), you stand to gain up to a hefty 3.80% APY on savings when you set up a direct deposit or have $5,000 or more in Qualifying Deposits and 0.50% APY on checking balances — savings APY is 10 times more than the national average. Right now, a direct deposit of at least $1K not only sets you up for higher returns but also brings you closer to earning up to a $300 welcome bonus (terms apply). You can easily deposit checks via your phone’s camera, transfer funds, and get customer service via chat or phone call. There are no account fees, no monthly fees and no overdraft fees. And your money is FDIC insured (up to $3M of additional FDIC insurance through the SoFi Insured Deposit Program). It’s quick and easy to open an account with SoFi Checking and Savings (member FDIC) and watch your money grow faster than ever. 6. Earn Up to $100 this Month By Answering Survey Questions About the News The news is a heated subject these days. It’s hard not to have an opinion on it. Good news: A website called YouGov will pay you up to $100 or more this month just to answer survey questions about politics, the economy, and other hot news topics. Plus, it’s totally anonymous, so no one will judge you for that hot take. When you take a quick survey (some are less than three minutes), you’ll earn points you can exchange for up to $100 in cash or gift cards to places like Walmart and Amazon. Plus, Penny Hoarder readers will get an extra 500 points for registering and another 1,000 points after completing their first survey. It takes just a few minutes to sign up and take your first survey, and you’ll receive your points immediately. 7. Earn $1000/Month by Reviewing Games and Products You Love Okay, real talk—everything is crazy expensive right now, and let’s be honest, we could all use a little extra cash. But who has time for a second job? Here’s the good news. You’re already playing games on your phone to kill time, relax, or just zone out. So why not make some extra cash while you’re at it? With KashKick, you can actually get paid to play. No weird surveys, no endless ads, just real money for playing games you’d probably be playing anyway. Some people are even making over $1,000 a month just doing this! Oh, and here’s a little pro tip: If you wanna cash out even faster, spending $2 on an in-app purchase to skip levels can help you hit your first $50+ payout way quicker. Once you’ve got $10, you can cash out instantly through PayPal—no waiting around, just straight-up money in your account. Seriously, you’re already playing—might as well make some money while you’re at it. Sign up for KashKick and start earning now!\n",

      "Question: Can you share your experience as a software engineer working with blockchain technology? Are there any new job opportunities in this field?\n",
      "True Answer: Most of the work in the blockchain tech area is around development of decentralized apps / Dapp-s and calling smart contracts. From my point of view of a developer this is relatively simple programming involving calling the api of a specific blockchain. However in the last few years such development did command high salaries in funded crypto startups. Since the end of 2022 the focus of investors shifted towards AI related projects and many crypto projects did fold and disappear. There are still opportunities in the field but they may not be as well paid as before and may require much broader set of skills than blockchain tech.\n",

      "Question: What should I add in resume as a new grad while applying for entry level product manger position?\n",
      "True Answer: These are characteristics I look for in a product manager resume:Be Clear About Ownership - I want to hire product managers who \"initiate\", \"create\", \"own\" and \"operate\". I'm less inclined to hire product managers who \"work on\", \"were part of a team that\", etc. Be truthful. Don't say you owned something that you worked on within a team, but by all means if you did initiate, create or own a major product, feature or initiative say so clearly on your resume. For example: \"Overall responsibility for converting new (i.e. trial) users into active users, including strategy, project idea generation,Continue ReadingThese are characteristics I look for in a product manager resume:Be Clear About Ownership - I want to hire product managers who \"initiate\", \"create\", \"own\" and \"operate\". I'm less inclined to hire product managers who \"work on\", \"were part of a team that\", etc. Be truthful. Don't say you owned something that you worked on within a team, but by all means if you did initiate, create or own a major product, feature or initiative say so clearly on your resume. For example: \"Overall responsibility for converting new (i.e. trial) users into active users, including strategy, project idea generation, and project prioritization.\"Describe Your Leadership Experience - Even if you're applying for an individual contributor role, state what leadership experience you've had. Mention number and duration of direct reports, interns/junior PM's you've mentored, or other ways you've led others.Use Data - Imagine the reader saying, \"So what?\" after reading every sentence of your resume. If there is something impressive about what you did, answer the question. Ideally, answer it with data and communicate it appropriately. For example: \"Grew world-wide trial-to-active user conversion from 10.6% for FY 2009 to 14.2% for FY 2010, an increase of 360bps\".Skip the Objective and Summary Sections - Your objective is to get a job at my company. I know that if I'm looking at your resume. Skip the boilerplate objective that says you're looking for a challenging, blah, blah role. Also skip the summary section that discusses your qualities. Saying you are a seasoned leader in a summary doesn't convince anyone. The roles, accomplishments and deliveries in your resume are where you can demonstrate this.Pick the Right Technical Skills to Include - If you have built technology yourself or are adept at SQL and other query languages then go ahead and add a technical skills section. Skip the section if you're just using it to show that you are familiar with the MSOffice Suite and Windows 7.Make Sure it Matches Your LinkedIn Profile - The first thing I do when I get a resume is look a candidate up on LinkedIn. I scan their profile and look at mutual connections. If I see different stuff there than on your resume (e.g. a degree in progress vs. a completed degree) then warning bells go off. Fix it.Find a Messenger - Avoid submitting a resume through a company's job site. If possible, try to find out who the hiring manager is, then find mutual connections. LinkedIn works great for this. If you can, email it to them directly with a very brief cover letter. If you can't, find someone you know at the company who can refer you. Some companies pay a referral bonus so if you're going to go through a referrer who's not the hiring manager send your resume to them first. Don't submit it through the jobs site and then email it to your contact.Finally, a word on cover letters. Some hiring managers like them, some don't. I don't. A long cover letter might actually delay me in reviewing the resume, since I feel I need to slog through the cover letter as well. If you must add a cover letter, then simply name drop and pick one or two of your most meaningful accomplishments.\n",

It might not be in computer science, but that’s okay because computer science professionals aren’t narrow automatons, and they exist in the wide world of ideas and people.People change with time. You may be average now by some measure, but you don’t have to stay that way — and may not. Strive to always learn and be better at the the things that matter. Too many “average” people don’t try, when even small changes would make them stand out.Your “average,” now, is learning how to do things with a computer that 100s of elite scientists couldn’t dream of doing a few centuries ago. What you are learning to do can be applied in myriad ways over your career to change the world. You could assist in anything from space exploration to discovering a new medical therapy to taming fusion power to keeping utilities working for millions to enabling disabled people to live independently to educating poor children in countries around the world…and more. That’s really powerful, and most of it will be done by “average” people doing those extraordinary things together.\n",

      "Question: Should a computer science student look for internships in the field of data analysis to get into the field or work more on skills before placements?\n",
      "True Answer: Always take internships or work experience when you can get it. If your goal is to work in a particular industry, try to find opportunities in the field you want to work in or one closely related to it. If you cannot find work, try to identify why you're not getting callbacks or job offers. Is it that you lack a particular skill that is common to the field you're aiming for?

If your goal is to work in a particular industry, try to find opportunities in the field you want to work in or one closely related to it. If you cannot find work, try to identify why you're not getting callbacks or job offers. Is it that you lack a particular skill that is common to the field you're aiming for? At the same time, when you're unable to find work in your target industry, try to work on projects that will demonstrate competence in that area. As for hiring in data analytics, it may be hard to find internships in that field at large companies until you're a rising senior or in a master's. It's a hot area to work in so you're going to be competing with seniors, recent grads, and grad students (some possibly at the PhD level as well). You should have a list of places you'd want to work and identify as precisely as possible what roles you're trying to get hired for. Do some research on what skills people in that industry have and expect. I'd guess R, Python, MATLAB, SAS, or language is desired. VBA scripting may also be desirable in some places. Version control, probably using git, will be a requirement almost everywhere, and it would be challenging to do analytics if you didn't know a little SQL. But you will need to figure out exactly what is required for the roles you're targeting. Bottom line: try to get internships or work if you can. If that fails, build projects you can easily show people using the skills you would use in the target role. A tip here is to build a PowerPoint deck of those projects which you can share with your resume when getting started. Or put them on a personal website (these are easy to build using Hugo, and Google will service a domain name for about 12 bucks a year; azure or netlify makes hosting a site pretty easy as well via a git repository).\n",

But usually people do a summer internship between 3rd and 4th year. It might be difficult to get an internship during the school year. But if you don’t get an internship, there are still many things you can do to impress potential employers. If you don’t have one yet, create a github account and post examples of your work there. You need to be able to show what you can do. Think of github as your portfolio. The next thing you should do is start contributing to open source code. Either create your own libraries, or submit pull requests to existing ones. Some people get very protective of their open source libraries, so don’t be offended if your pull request doesn’t get approved and merged. Another huge thing you can do is start to unit test your code. This will help you in so many ways. When you unit test code, you verify that the code is doing what you think it is doing. I don’t think they teach unit testing in school. Or at least I’ve never seen a college graduate who understood good unit testing practices. So that would be a huge thing you could do to differentiate yourself from all the other college graduates applying to the same jobs you apply to. TL;DR: 1) Create github, post examples of work. 2) Contribute to open source 3) Unit test\n",

These are different forms of communication, but the process of bringing them to fruition has a necessary, sometimes overlooked step: editing! Unless you’re a professional writer, it’s unlikely that you have an editor who can review your writing regularly. Here are some tips to help you review your own work.Give your writing some space. Have you ever felt a mix of pure relief and joy when you’ve finished a draft of something? Don’t downplay that feeling and the ability to walk away from your work before you start editing it. You may need minutes, hours, or days, but once you sit back down with what you originally had on the page, you’ll have the thrill of looking at it with fresh eyes. You’ll notice errors you may not have seen the first time. You’ll come to new realizations about its overall tone and structure. If it’s a text or email, maybe you only need a few minutes away from it. If it’s a story or essay, perhaps you’ll need longer. Regardless of what type of work it is, it will help your writing tremendously.Don’t use overachieving synonyms. Looking at your work for the second, third, or fourth time around may inspire you to spice up your language with longer, more uncommon words. There’s nothing wrong with having a thesaurus nearby, but try to limit the repetition of long, pretentious-feeling words so your work flows well and doesn’t feel too bogged down. At the end of the day, you want it to feel true to you and the message you’re conveying.Remember who the reader is. Don’t forget your own voice as the writer—but don’t forget who your reader is. Many writers get too close to their work; editing is a chance to try to get out of your own head. Who is your ideal reader? What do you want them to take away from the writing? It’s a unique time to step in their shoes, to make sure your communication is as effective as you’d like it to be.Kill your darlings. Don’t be scared to remove chunks of your work, even if it feels precious to you. If it’s a passage that’s really tough to part with, try saving it somewhere else, so you can return to it later in your piece or for another work.Use Grammarly. Last but not least, Grammarly has countless resources for editing your work. Our writing assistant helps you find areas of your writing that are unclear or too wordy, as well as help you find mistakes you might not have caught.Editing may feel tedious, but it’s just as important as writing itself.

You seem to be asking about experiences in industry since obviously there is a huge difference between a Master's and a PhD in academia. My PhD in artificial intelligence (AI) had a pretty strong influence on my career in industry in both positive and negative ways for a LONG time (over a decade) after graduation. On the positive side, it often opened doors for me at companies that had an interest in AI that would not have hired me without that degree. On the negative side, I was also limited by the AI label a lot, and I often found it difficult to be taken seriously as a \"general purpose\" programmer even with years of experience with more mainstream technologies outside of the limited AI space. If the job was AI related at all, I was usually hired on the spot--but anything else and I was not seriously considered, even though I felt I had a lot more in my bag of tricks than just AI.

      "True Answer: One of the biggest things I struggled with early on was knowing when to stop investing in something and pivot to something else. It’s really easy to explain this concept to someone, but a whole other ordeal to live it and have to make the call yourself. As a new PM, I didn’t have experience working on projects where we cut scope or we didn’t “finish” what we initially agreed to.

It’s really easy to explain this concept to someone, but a whole other ordeal to live it and have to make the call yourself. As a new PM, I didn’t have experience working on projects where we cut scope or we didn’t “finish” what we initially agreed to. My priors were based on school projects and internships which, in all cases, your goal is literally to finish the task you’ve been given. You can push back at internships, but you likely won’t get very far if you go to a professor and try to explain why you shouldn’t have to do your homework. One piece of advice I give to people who are deciding between starting out as a new grad PM (especially when you’re not going to an APM program) vs. as an engineer, designer, data scientist, etc is that transitioning later on may help address this struggle that I had. For me, I had to learn this skill on the job while leading a team. But, if you started out in a different function, you might have the opportunity to work on projects where the scope gets cut or pivoting happens, which gives you some experiences to draw from and examples to pattern match against.The other major struggle I have that I think is a “wake up call” to most new grad PMs who don’t have PM internship experience is that it’s tough to start our first job and feel like you’re starting from zero. This is especially tough for overachievers, which probably represents a ton of people who want to be product managers. Another factor that makes this difficult is that there are very tangible ways to measure progress and “grade” yourself in school (and in engineering, to some extent). These things don’t translate into Product Management, so for the first months I was constantly worried that I wasn’t growing or that I wasn’t meeting expectations. Thankfully, I have a great manager and team who have taught me countless lessons and have helped me understand the impact I’m having, even when I was new. I also had to often remind myself that it was okay that I was struggling and that I consciously decided to make a career switch to a function that I didn’t directly train for in college. That’s not to say that there weren’t extremely difficult times, but I managed to work through the periods of self doubt thanks to the awesome mentors I have around me.All in all, starting out as a product manager (instead of transitioning later on) isn’t impossible, but it does come with its challenges. Neither is better or worse for all people or in all situations. There were a lot of struggles, but I wouldn’t trade my experience for anything. If you’re going to start as a PM straight out of college, I think you both have to be emotionally prepared to push through the tough times and also find a company and team where you have strong mentorship and support. I also wrote a related answer about what it’s like to be a PM when you’re also younger than many other people on your team[1] .Footnotes[1] Elynn Lee's answer to In a product management role, is it challenging being younger than many of the other people on your team?\n",

      "Assistant answer: Product managers often face unique challenges when it comes to managing projects. Some of these challenges include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Managing stakeholders with diverse needs and expectations: Product managers must work closely with different teams, departments, and individuals to meet their specific requirements. This can be challenging because each stakeholder has different priorities and goals.\n",
      "2. Balancing time constraints and resource availability: Product managers must prioritize which projects need more resources or attention while still meeting deadlines. This can be difficult because there may be limited budget or personnel available for project completion.\n",
      "3. Communicating effectively across multiple channels: Product managers must communicate complex ideas and decisions clearly and effectively through various communication channels such as email, meetings, and presentations. This requires excellent writing skills and the ability to deliver concise and effective messages.\n",
      "4. Dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty: Product managers often work on projects with uncertain outcomes or unknown risks. They must use their judgment and decision-making skills to make informed choices based on available information and data.\n",
      "5. Adapting to changing market conditions and customer needs: As technology and consumer behavior evolve, product managers must continually adapt their strategies and approaches to remain competitive. This requires them to stay up-to-date with industry trends, market research, and customer feedback.\n",
      "6. Overcoming technical obstacles: Product managers may encounter technical issues or bugs during development. They must identify and resolve these problems efficiently to maintain product functionality and user satisfaction.\n",
      "7. Managing conflicts and relationships with team members and stakeholders: Product managers often lead cross-functional teams and interact with different stakeholders, including clients, developers, designers, and other team members. Managing conflicts and building positive relationships with all parties is crucial for successful project management.\n",
      "8. Ensuring compliance with regulations and legal standards: Product managers must ensure their products comply with relevant laws, regulations, and ethical standards to protect users' privacy, safety, and interests.\n",
      "9. Balancing innovation and stability: Product managers must balance the desire for new features and innovations against maintaining a stable and reliable product. This requires careful planning, testing, and iteration to address potential issues and maintain overall quality and performance.\n",
      "10. Staying agile and adapting to change: With fast-paced technological advancements and evolving customer demands, product managers must continuously adapt their strategies and processes to keep up with changing market conditions and customer needs.

In this case, since it is not in the same industry (although there are situations where there could be overlap or a relationship), that would be of some assistance provided the employer looks at it objectively. Finally, it is not uncommon, where the employee is leaving on good terms and joining a non competitor, for the current employer to provide a letter waiving the noncompete. In that case, your answer on the application as to whether there is a non compete, would be “no”.\n",

      "\n",
      "Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are two widely recognized cloud computing platforms with extensive certification programs. Both certifications can be beneficial for professionals working in the IT industry or those seeking employment in this sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Google Cloud Platform Certification:\n",
      "   - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) certification allows individuals to demonstrate their skills in managing Google Cloud resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking.\n",
      "   - Certifications range from GCP Cloud Engineer to GCP Cloud Architect.\n",
      "   - A GCP Cloud Engineer certificate costs $295 and requires passing one exam out of three possible exams.\n",
      "   - The cost of an AWS Certified Professional certification varies depending on the exam you choose; however, the minimum price is $300.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification:\n",
      "   - An AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (ACP) certification demonstrates knowledge in developing and deploying applications using AWS services.\n",
      "   - The certification costs $675 and requires passing both the 1Z-044 and 1Z-062 exams.\n",
      "   - The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (ACP) certification also offers discounts for multi-year subscriptions, which can save money over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both certifications offer value to individuals seeking a competitive edge in the IT industry. However, they have different focus areas and requirements. If your primary interest lies in cloud computing, Google Cloud Platform may be more suitable due to its specialization in managed infrastructure services. Conversely, if you're interested in enterprise-level solutions, an AWS certification would be preferable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, both Google Cloud Platform and AWS certifications can be valuable additions to any IT professional's skillset. The choice between the two depends on individual interests, work experience, and personal preference.\n",

      "Networking is an important skill for anyone looking to advance their career. Online mentorship platforms can be particularly helpful for those looking to connect with professionals in their industry or field of interest. Here are some ways that these platforms can help:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Connecting you with experts: Many online mentorship platforms allow you to connect with experienced professionals who can offer guidance and advice on various topics related to your field. This can be especially valuable for beginners or those seeking to learn more about a particular topic.\n",
      "2. Providing access to a large pool of professionals: These platforms often have a wide range of members from different industries and backgrounds, allowing you to find mentors who share your interests and expertise.\n",
      "3. Facilitating communication and collaboration: Platforms may also provide tools for messaging and video conferencing between mentors and mentees, making it easier to stay connected and collaborate on projects or tasks.\n",
      "4. Offering support and accountability: Some platforms may provide resources such as training materials, study groups, or community forums where mentors can offer feedback and support along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, it's important to note that while online mentorship platforms can be beneficial, they should not replace traditional networking opportunities entirely. In-person meetings and events can still play a crucial role in building relationships and expanding your network. Additionally, depending on the platform and its specific features, there may be limitations or drawbacks to using these services.\n",

I’m not saying that your Communication Skills are more important than your Technical, but with established technical experience, people are looking for potential influential leaders, not programmers in the basement.Later Career - Your Communication, and other Soft-Skills start to take prominence. No longer are you expected to “just” program, but you will be working with more and more end-users, driving standards, etc., all of this takes good Communication Skills.This is why some people have issues finding jobs that meet their compensation desires as they become more senior (see below) and look for new careers. What a company is looking for is changed. Even if you are an expert on blockchain, if you can’t help bring up the level of the team, then I can hire a less experienced person and get the same (or more) value. Now, if you are able to communicate the idea of Blockchain to Senior leadership and get them excited about the possibilities, that is worth gold. Good luck!\n",

I’ve earned over $1,000 in one month without ‘living’ on the platform. I was skeptical right up until the moment I cashed out to my PayPal. What is Freecash all about? Basically, it’s a platform that pays you for testing apps and games and completing surveys. This helps developers improve their applications while you make some money.You can earn by downloading apps, testing games, or completing surveys. I love playing games, so that’s where most of my earnings came from (oh, and my favorites were Warpath, Wild Fish, and Domino Dreams).There’s a variety of offers (usually, the higher-paying ones take more time).Some games can pay up to $1,000 for completing a task, but these typically require more hours to finish.On average, you can easily earn $30–50/day.You pick your options — you’re free to choose whatever apps, games, and surveys you like.Of course, it’s not like you can spend 5 minutes a day and become a millionaire. But you can build a stable income in reasonable time, especially if you turn it into a daily habit. Why did I like Freecash?It’s easy. I mean it. You don’t have to do anything complicated. All you need is to follow the task and have some free time to spend on it. For some reason, I especially enjoyed the game Domino Dreams. My initial goal was to complete chapter 10 to get my first $30, but I couldn’t stop playing and ended up completing chapter 15. It was lots of fun and also free money: $400 from that game alone.No experience needed. Even if you’ve never done any ‘testing’ before, you can do this. You get straightforward task descriptions, so it’s impossible to go wrong. A task you might expect is something like: Download this game and complete all challenges in 14 days.You can do it from anywhere. I was earning money while taking the bus, chilling on the couch, and during my breaks.Fast cashing out. I had my earnings in my PayPal account in less than 1 day. I’m not sure how long it takes for other withdrawal methods (crypto, gift cards, etc.), but it should be fast as well.You can earn a lot if you’re consistent. I’ve literally seen users in the Leaderboard making $3,000 in just one month. Of course, to get there, you need time, but making a couple of hundred dollars is really easy and relatively fast for anyone.Don’t miss these PRO tips to earn more: I feel like most users don’t know about these additional ways to make more money with Freecash:Free promo codes: You can follow Freecash on social media to get weekly promo codes for free coins, which you can later exchange for money.Daily rewards and bonuses: If you use the platform daily, you’ll get additional bonuses that help you earn more.In-app purchases to speed up processes: While playing, you can buy items to help speed up task completion. It’s optional, but it really saved me time, and I earned 4x more than I spent.Choose the highest-paying offers: Check New Offers and Featured Offers to get the best opportunities that pay the most.Honestly, I still can’t believe I was able to earn this much so easily. And I’ve actually enjoyed the whole process. So, if you’re looking for some truly legit ways to earn money online, Freecash is a very good option.\n",

Read the section on the job description where it says \"requirements\" and put all those requirements in your resume as your \"skills\". 2. SPELL CHECK Enough said. 3. Keep it short and sweet. When I was younger I managed a customer service department and I would get in applications that were 3 pages long. I had 50 applications to get through, a week to hire a new representative and didn't have time to read a novel so those ones got put to the bottom of the stack. I would suggest keeping it to one page if at all possible. 4. Don't print your resume on both sides of the paper To tie in with the last point, if it does go over one page, DO NOT print the second page on the back side of the first. Print it on a separate page. Again, applications are initially skimmed through at a vigorous pace and if there is something printed on the back that's vital information about you, it mostly likely will never be seen and you risk your resume looking unfinished. 5. Have 3 solid references who are not related to you. This is basic for any application you've ever filled out and it's likely they will never get called but in the off chance that your future employer does call, don't rely on Uncle Ricky to secure you that position.\n",

You would be fortunate to work for such a company. Many software engineers for example are known for introversion, which isn’t a bad thing. They are highly productive and prone to high focus which are great assets to productivity. They are not known however for their ability to work as part of a larger network (sometimes) and unfortunately are sometimes viewed as uncooperative. Not true of course, but that sometimes is the perception of those who prefer to do solo or focused work. Because some organizations take a team approach integrating software engineers to be part of the process from inception working along with designers and project managers, the software engineers ability to communicate in ways that walk a line between technical and layman to the other team members is important. Different disciplines often speak in different language or jargon. The difficulties that come these frustrations of not feeling heard, or understood sometimes show up in the form of behaviors that are passive aggressive, or sometimes not as friendly as they could be. Thus, it’s likely the company would rather know the strong suits of a candidate or where they might need to apply development from the outset. This way they can make placement with the most compatible teams or strongest managers as necessary. And, this is all to the the happiest outcome of the existing team and the new hire. So, it’s not necessarily a negative request to have that interview....\n",

In this type of interview, the candidate will be asked hypothetical questions about scenarios they might encounter in the workplace, and they will need to explain how they would approach those situations and communicate effectively with other team members. This type of interview also helps assess the candidate's communication style, leadership abilities, and technical skills, which are all important components of a successful software engineer.

So to answer your question how can you get a job as a cyber security expert, it depends on lot of things 1. Your background 2. Your interest (red team versus blue team: red team attacks and blue team defends and both are equally important) 3. Market/job opportunity You can be an inch deep and miles wide in security or you can be inch wide and miles deep. For example there are different skill set required based on at which layer(network, OS,application , data) you are providing security. For example 1. Network security (IPS, proxy, web filtering, email filtering, firewall, APT detection, next gen firewall and so on ) 2. Endpoint security (mostly desktops,mobile and laptops) 3. Application security (code review, white box testing, black box testing and all three requires different kind of skill sets) 4. Server security (web server, application server, database servers) 5. Data security ( encryption, DRM, tokenization, compliance , data classification and policies and so forth) 6. Network forensics or endpoint forensics 7. Incident response and security monitoring 8 malware analysis and reversing 9. Hardware hacking (p0wning IoT devices smart meters, phones or Barbie dolls for fun) 10. Surveillance (man in the middle for cell phones, sessions , cookie stealing, and so on) These are some of the high level buckets you have to think about and what matches your background. But before you do that I would strongly advice following . 1. Read the entire TCP/IP illustrated volume I and when you finish it, read it one more time. If you can't finish the whole book atleast read first 10 chapters. You can thank me later. 2. Read basics of port scanning on Port Scanning Basics this will give you an idea on how the first stage of attack is (reconnaissance) is conducted. 3. Read up on cyber kill chain Title 4. Download kali from Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Linux Distribution and learn the tools by testing it on your own servers or desktops. DO NOT scan or run any attack tools from Kali on the digital asset you do not own. Laws are strict. 5. Once you are familiar with Kali and tools, Start with CTF (capture the flag) and try and solve few challenges. CTF365: Capture the Flag Now you have basics to conquer any advanced stuff in network and data security. For application security specially for white box testing or security code review you should have some programming background. Application security , malware reversing and security monitoring are really hot. Depending on the vertical you choose data security and compliance can be really in demand for example financial , healthcare or retail. Last but not least, there are ton of books on the topics I mentioned above , and ton of material on Phrack Magazine ::. Which is really advance. Now after all this if you say on top of this I have CISSP or CISA then it holds some water but it won't automatically get you a job just because you are CISSP . By the way there is an inside joke within security community but may be will table that for some other time. Good luck and I promise, you will never ever be bored in security.

      "True Answer: Startup: You’re riding a horse. Large company: You control the front left leg of a horse. You have just learned the horse has also a back right leg, which you knew nothing about until very recently. Tail wagging is controlled by a committee. There was a memo on the direction where the horse is heading, but you’re not quite sure who was supposed to cascade that memo to you.

You have just learned the horse has also a back right leg, which you knew nothing about until very recently. Tail wagging is controlled by a committee. There was a memo on the direction where the horse is heading, but you’re not quite sure who was supposed to cascade that memo to you. No, seriously - the biggest difference is in the number of meetings. Big corp - there’s lots and lots of meetings. And then there’s some more. If you actually want to get some work done - you have to schedule it in your calendar, otherwise it ain’t gonna happen. But you have got to be really slick how you go about it. Split that time in smaller chunks, as everybody knows that large 4–5h “busy” blocks in the calendar usually mean DND time, and before you know it you’ll kiss that time goodbye too. Ok, now seriously seriously. Startup is 90% product, 10% management. Large corp is 10% product, 90% management. As a PM, you’re expected to thrive in completely different areas:Startup - scrappy, moves & builds momentum fast, ruthlessly prioritize.Large corp - manage everyone’s expectations, generate shared reality, provide broader context to your team(s).The key differentiation is also in how you manage the roadmap - its visibility, and the way a project gets on the roadmap. In a big company, you’re expected to have at least 9–12 months of clear roadmap visibility. This is essential, due to mutual dependency and overall constellation w/ other teams and divisions. In a startup, having an epic (a project, whatever) on the 6-month roadmap is usually a one-liner, e.g. “we want to do X”. That doesn’t fly in a big corp; mid-term roadmap projects are usually scoped, designed, reviewed with engineering, and estimated to a relatively high level of confidence. You are effectively building the support for a project - product marketing and other dept’s are acquainted with them on a very high level, and executives and senior leaders need to know about them and be aligned with your project. You’re equally concerned with making sure you deliver stuff, as you are with putting things into proper constellation 6 months from now. That basically means you’ll work on projects that may, or may not get close to execution. That’s something a startup can’t afford to do, and usually doesn’t. It’s like driving a sports car vs. driving a truck - you want to make a sharp left turn? Not so easy; you have to plan well ahead. Essentially, you’re compensating agility for the firepower. Another key facet of the different roadmap approach is the fact that a big corp has plenty of resources for which you’re competing with other projects/teams. A startup is by default very scarce with resources, hence putting a project on the roadmap comes with a completely different set of constraints. Every major decision could have serious consequences on growth, acquisition and/or revenue, which you might not have the opportunity to mitigate later on. In a big company, you’re usually concerned with getting a buy-in from various stakeholders on why is X such a great opportunity, vs. other valid opportunities a same team could be pursuing. Or, let me put it like this:Startup: You’re entering a maze. You have one bullet in your Glock 17 handgun. You hit a target, you get another bullet. BAM, hit that one too, here’s another bullet. And so on.Corp: There are four shooters in front of the maze, each holding an empty HK416 with grenade launcher and red dot sight. Their team leader is holding three mags ready to distribute to shooters he believes have the best chance of getting to the level boss.And that’s basically the core difference between being a PM in a startup and a PM in a large tech company. … oh, did I mention meetings?\n",

Not every leader needs to be a manager, but everyone who is a manager should be a leader. Unfortunately, being a manager doesn't automatically make you a are a leader. And the reason is most organisations (and the individuals within them) either don't fully understand or have a limited understanding of what leadership actually means. There is no ready-made recipe for it however I summarised 5 crucial leadership attributes that new managers need to understand to lead their team effectively. Here they are:Self-awareness and leading by example: To display the desired behavioural changes, a leader must showcase them first. In organisations, managers often demand many things from their teams, saying, \"Let's do this,\" or \"Let's do that.\" However, they fail to do those things themselves. Do not expect others to do things you wouldn't do yourself. Change starts within oneself.Being barrier-free and transparent: You don't always have to appear strong and motivated in front of your teams. Instead, be transparent. Share openly when you lack motivation, make mistakes, or stumble. Show your team members that everyone is human, including yourself. Embedding this approach within the teams triggers a positive response.Building a strong team and continuous improvement: One of the most significant responsibilities of a leader is to build the right team and constantly strengthen it. This aspect is often overlooked. Your job is to manage the work, but you can only manage people. To manage people effectively, you must continuously uncover their abilities and talents and make the right hiring decisions. This is where you should invest most of your effort.Crafting a strategy and providing direction: As Seneca said, \"If a man knows not to which port he sails, no wind is favourable.\" Without clear goals, any tailwinds becomes useless.Focus on setting business objectives and removing obstacles to achieving them. Differentiate between work outputs and work objectives. For instance, saying, \"We have launched feature X\" is an output. However, if that feature didn't reduce our user acquisition costs, that's a result. One of the biggest mistakes is when managers constantly come up with their ow ideas or projects related to their team's area of expertise and engage in micro-management. Avoid doing this. Provide business objectives, and your team will be much more creative and effective in finding and implementing solutions to achieve those objectives. Your role is to clear the obstacles they encounter on the way to reaching those objectives.\n",

Which I encourage highly because it is a good thing and you should back yourself if you have invested quality time in a particular direction.

Which I encourage highly because it is a good thing and you should back yourself if you have invested quality time in a particular direction. But here’s the thing, while the assignments and programming exercises you did back during your courses taught you how to implement a lot of useful stuff, what they gave you ready and didn't make you do specifically is acquire and clean data which is easily 80% of Data Science. So that’s the first skill I want you to nail. I am listing down a few other skills that come to mind on careful pragmatic thought and I've arranged them priority wise although I highly recommend you tick off all of them before applying for an internship. Skill Number 1: Acquiring and Cleaning Data: It depends how you want to practice this. You could take up unclean datasets and clean them up or you could do a project with unclean data from start to the end. The second approach makes more sense if you don’t have projects to show on your CV. However, if you have done projects before, and have used unclean (raw) data in them to begin with, you can skip this and please, do not insult yourself by calling yourself a fresher. You’re better than that. Skill Number 2: Go back to the basics: And by basics, I mean statistics of course. Take a refresher course online on statistics and just brush through it. It might sound a little extra but speaking from practical experience, believe me a lot of “Data Scientists” lack even the basic statistical knowledge and as an interviewee, that is the one of the first things you’ll be checked for when you apply for internships. The first requirement to shine at an internship is to make sure you get in, right? Skill Number 3: Exploratory Data Analysis: This process involves generating questions, and investigating them with visualisations. One of the first tasks that I was given as an intern was to clean the data, and I quote my then superior, “give me creative visualisations of this data for me to present to my client”. This skill is underrated as hell. Everyone wants to just skip to the main course which is fine and the enthusiasm is understandable. But this skill is important as it makes you think from a business point of view and as data scientists, I emphasise heavily on developing that perspective. Understand the data, visualise the data, ask questions and then proceed in a direction. You don’t want to be a clueless data scientist who just tries model after model without a direction. Skill Number 4: Communication and Documentation: Effectively communicating results is what separates the good data scientists from the great ones. Ultimately, if you haven’t undertaken a research internship or assistantship, everything in the end is about selling a service or a product. It doesn’t matter how fancy your model is, if you can’t explain it your superiors or customers, you won’t get their buy-in. Also, for a research internship or really any internship, you need to be able to be good on paper. I mean good language, proper margins and formatting and a good clear sense of what you are trying to convey. This falls under the documentation domain which we usually run away from. Don’t anymore. A well documented research paper or report is necessary to make it stand out. If you can write it well, you can sell it well. I wish you all the good fortune. Nail it dude. And reach out to me if you need any assistance whatsoever. Cheers!\n",

At the company that created the dominant technologies for controlled delivery of drugs to body tissue (Transderm Scōp; Duragesic; Concerta), I saw our monthly employee database printout every month from 1980 - 2001. We were eerily 50–50, men and women. As VP of HR, it made one part of my job very gratifying. This was the result of our supervisory managers’ freehand decision-making. I didn’t have to go have a bunch of heart-to-heart talks. I wrote the nomination for our president to participate in a Silicon Valley award contest. From Fenwick.com’s Gender Diversity white paper 2014: Women were 46.8% of the U.S. labor force in 2013 and held 51.4% of management (considering all levels), professional and related positions in 2013. Here’s a point of reference based on research. One of the countless studies I read about the mechanisms of diversity or lack thereof described a “plateau effect”. That may not have been the article’s jargon. Its finding went something like this: changes in hiring patterns occur when a previously underrepresented group becomes numerous enough at the precursor levels that the decision-makers have more than one member of the non-traditional group among the finalists. If you have five finalists and two are women, they’re still a minority 60–40. But, the odds are far better than when you have four men and only one woman. “The only woman” is a tougher decision during a transitional era. Later, when it’s pretty natural, decision-makers are less likely to believe that they might be missing some disqualifying factor that tracks to gender.\n",

After release if we get some grand treat from management, that is also appreciated and enjoyed . like other jobs s/w engineers also like - appreciation work life balance support from boss Best thing happened during covid-19 pandemic lockdown , s/w engineers enjoyed very nice family life , though they were busy - they were along with their family . That was a great experience IT professionals had gone through - working from home for more than 2 years ( for majority of IT engineers). Again majority of software engineers like to travel to different places with onsite opportunities - a nice way to explore new places and people , even I enjoy this very much. Few other things are coming to my mind - when effect is little different :) I would like to put these situations by which you can find out about the mantel health of a software engineer : 1. It was not more than 10 days when I was part of a team , where one of my senior team member by mistake deleted one DB object . The matter went to my manager in minutes , he came out of his cabin and started telling - 'I don't know what is going to happen today .. if your job is important for you , don't move away from office till the time issue is resolved .' - Luckily the deleted db object was recovered within 1 hour with the help of DBA , but within that 1 hour more than 25 production issues were raised with different blockages .. All the team members were sitting in the office till 4 O'clock morning . I was new to the team , as part of the team I was also noticing those as a live movie 2. Saturday and Sunday - are off-work in software companies . Family will be expecting your time . But when there will be weekend release scheduled and you have to be there as per the instruction from your boss , that too in early morning - what will your mind say !! Again after attending deployment for a window 6 AM to 11 AM say ,if you get some post deployment issues , which need be fixed ASAP .. user acceptance testers are waiting for the issue to be fixed , time is going ... and going ... you are getting calls from your family when you will be back .... you are on top of the issue which is not resolved yet ... what will be your mental health ... the Saturday has gone already ... Saturday evening started :) ..you are there at office from morning 6 AM ... :) 3. you are performing your best .. delivering in time , some day because of something may be some personal issue .. you missed some mail , or you missed some timeline ..your manager will call you separately ... and tell you .. 'you are not giving 100% .. please put your 100% so that I can help you ' ... that also happens to many :) 4. I met a boss - he didn't want to listen 'No' .. he is always right . at 4 Pm if he tells - this issue needs to be fixed today .. I don't care if you need to burn the mid night oil for that , tomorrow morning I don't want to see this issue - great experience :) 5. One interesting tool I have seen in software company is ' Bell curve ' used by many managers - to do the performance review . If you are once at the left or right side of the bell curve - during every performance review you will discover yourself there only every year .. when you talk with your manager , he will explain many things , many scenarios and you you will come out of his cabin to perform better and work more for next one year . This happens in many software engineer's life :)\n",

In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Pro helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance, Grammarly Pro now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way.Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers. Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Pro, speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Pro’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar. Simply click on the suggestion highlighted in green, and voila, your English will be more polished and accurate.PS: Tailored suggestions for other language backgrounds are on the way!\n",

Women were invariably at the top of the class and many ladies did well when we men struggled. Then for some reason women stopped taking CS classes. I think the culture at work discouraged them.

      "Circles Method\n",
      "\n",
      "The Circles Method is a popular technique used by many interviewers to assess candidates' technical skills. It involves asking questions that circle around a single topic or concept, allowing candidates to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the subject matter. The process can be challenging but rewarding, as it helps candidates showcase their abilities and communicate effectively with the interviewer.\n",
      "\n",
      "To use the Circles Method during an interview, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Begin by introducing the topic you want to cover (e.g., data structures).\n",
      "2. Ask the candidate a few simple yes/no questions related to the topic.\n",
      "3. If the candidate answers \"yes,\" move on to another question.\n",
      "4. If they answer \"no,\" ask more detailed questions to probe further into their knowledge and understanding of the topic.\n",
      "5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until the candidate demonstrates sufficient knowledge or moves onto other topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that the Circles Method should only be used to gauge your technical skills and abilities. Don't let it become a crutch or excuse for poor performance. Instead, use it as a tool to help you improve and demonstrate your strengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while the Circles Method may seem daunting at first, it can be a useful tool for demonstrating your technical expertise during an interview. By focusing on one topic and asking probing questions, you can showcase your knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.\n",

Even if you had all of that, Mr, Joe, BSc, MSc, PhD, and whatnot, you might still not make it as “quant” (ignoring the fact that quant as job entails 1001 jobs). Why?

Even if you had all of that, Mr, Joe, BSc, MSc, PhD, and whatnot, you might still not make it as “quant” (ignoring the fact that quant as job entails 1001 jobs). Why? Because you could be the brightest lad on the street, however, if you fail to interpret your results and outcome accordingly, or not understand the intricacy of market dynamics, methodology and concepts of what you are doing, and why you are doing it no one will push you near a quant desk. And the ones who do will regret having put you there. There are a 1001 and examples of extremely bright lads which will fail as quant. A high IQ and 24 degrees might get you an interview at best. Coding skills? Like I said before, concepts. What is the problem? What do I have to do? I have financial IT software vendors coming to me. Hey Ross, we can do this bucket of products. But it can not do IR swaps. Can you produce a simple, driven on functionality and concept tool that does this? Comply with internal, regulatory rules and aligned with model committees? Can you from scratch model a simple box in Matlab to price swaptions with a intuitive GUI which you stick feeds in, do the pricing/risk engine and feed it back to other systems? Its one out of 1000 examples. It doesn't matter in which language you code it (pending the problem some might be favourable over others), what matters is that you produce what intuitively makes sense. And not start first with, 1) I pick python 2) then try to solve the problem. Thats a wrong approach. Every language has its benefits. These guys below, we all know em', f# em.Because I can tell when the code is absolute hogwash, has 00s of lines which are irrelevant, output makes little to no sense, etc.Which tells me they have the ability to do as required but lack concept, the bigger picture as to why they did this exercise. And that is just sad. I want functionality and understanding. I don't care about the rest. I care 0 because it has a printing button, why did you not deliver as requested? A quantitative trader needs to understand concepts, the role the various desks do, what other traders do, what risk managers do, what the bank is trying to achieve. You don't need 24 degrees and an high IQ for that. You need logical reasoning, concept thinking, and ability to see through noise to achieve that. Nothing more. Many fail in that. They calculate X, yet then conclude based on this utter rubbish… You can calculate risk on a mortgage portfolio, and do so exquisite. 10/10. But if you can't figure out what it meant you are useless. Do we need to buy more hedges? Do we have a timing mismatch between front and backbook? What do your results mean? Come on…\n",

Based on it, during the 6th semester, I spent most of my time in Coding and learning core cs subjects(OS, DBMS, Networking). At the end of the 3rd year, I was pretty confident with my Coding skills and knowledge of core cs subjects.As coming to summer's preparation, you should be precise about the topics, skills, subjects, and languages that you are going to prepare during this period. and remember, \"Consistency is the key\". In the next sections, there are some exciting tips for you, based on how I prepared in summer.I can share the strategy I used for my summer preparation. You can cherry-pick the points you think can improve your skills. Make Notes This habit could benefit you in numerous ways. Two months of summer is a lengthy span, and in core CS subjects, most of the vital content is theoretical. So it's a good practice to keep them organized in your handy notes. Write down the key points of all the topics that you think are important and keep revising them. When your placement session begins, these notes help you in quick revision before interviews as well. Improve your Communication All your knowledge only makes sense if you communicate it elegantly. Many times, we knew the solution but are unable to put it the way it is in our minds. That's why it is essential to learn \"how to explain\". For this, you could use the following methods I practiced, and they worked for me.Do both sides (Interviewer and interviewee) - Take a pen, paper, and a set of questions with known solutions. Start by explaining the question loudly to yourself (Interviewer), then explain the solution in the same way(Interviewee). Keep improving it till you got satisfied with yourself. I prefer you to do this exercise daily for two coding questions(with known solutions).Give mock interviews - \"Thou shalt not get nervous in interviews😛\" Do you get nervous in interviews? The less nervous you are, the more effectively you communicate. A mock interview is the best way to deal with your anxiety and nervousness. Mock interviews boost confidence. It's better to stammer in mock interviews than in real ones. There are some excellent websites that provide a platform for mock interviews. You can try Pramp(Mock Interview Site).Discuss with a friend - Discuss your knowledge with a friend. Decide topics that you are going to study during the day and, in the evening, ask tough questions from each other. Take his/her mock interviews, discuss what should be the best answer to an HR question, ask puzzles. In this way, you never skip anything. I used to do all these exercises with my batchmate, and we came up with some creative HR answers too 😛.Coding Remember the days when you used to stuck with one coding question all day long. Don't do this in summer, because you don't have much time, right? Here are some coding habits, which might help you in interviews, online tests, and utilizing your summer season efficiently.Take at least one short contest (duration: 1-2 hrs and questions: 3-4) daily. I used to take Leetcode's virtual and mock contests.Restrict the time that you spend to come up with an approach. I set my limit to 45 mins. If even after 45 mins, I couldn't be able to come with an approach, then I used to jump into the solution section.You find some algorithms or methods tough to get in the head, or you forget them very often. It's because those algorithms are not in your daily coding routine. For example, there are many famous named algorithms to find the shortest path in graphs, but you only use the most efficient ones in Coding. So better play safe with the rest of them. Write them down and keep revising regularly.\"If your coding skills are weak, then try to spend most of your time improving it. Everything else would make sense only if you clear Round1 first.\" In summers, the platforms I used to practice Coding are Leetcode and Codeforces. And GeeksForGeeks articles for learning data structures and graphs algorithms. System Design I believe this is the part about which most of you are afraid, so were I. For \"freshers\" like us, this round is mostly logical and based on the syllabus contents. For example,The Interviewer could ask you to design an ER or UML diagram of an application or any project mentioned in the resume.He could ask you to optimize a particular task in an application.Object-oriented modeling-related questions.Any other logical task related to system designing.Also, try to learn system designs of popular apps or websites like BookMyShow, Twitter, etc. I took the help of the Youtube channel Tech Dummies and some random Medium articles whichever I found easy to understand 😃. Puzzles Puzzles are used to check the interviewee's presence of mind and problem-solving ability. In general, many companies avoid asking puzzles, but still, they are in fashion. The following are the resources that I've used to increase my puzzling skills.InterviewBit puzzle section.Logically Yours (Youtube Channel)GeeksForGeeks Puzzle sectionDon't feel puzzles as an extra load. I prefer you to solve 2 to 4 puzzles daily. This won't take much of your time, and at the end of summer, you will be knowing nearly 200 puzzles(and that's a lot). CS Subjects The subjects I prepared for are DSA, Computer Networks, OS, and DBMS. You can add more subjects based on your interests. How much time you should spend on learning or revising each of them depends on your current knowledge. My DBMS was weak, so I used to give relatively more time to study its concepts. Geeksforgeeks has a great collection of asked interview questions from these subjects. “In Leetcode's discussion section, users keep posting their latest interview experiences worldwide. Have a look at them too 😃” Resume A resume is your first impression. You could use templates provided by our college or resume-building websites. I started working on my resume in the first week of July. I urge you to go through the link to make a better resume. Some Interview TipsWhen you stumble with a new question in interviews, don't get nervous. Instead, try to deal with it constructively. Just share whatever approach (even if it's incomplete) you have in mind with the Interviewer, he would surely help you to think in the right direction.Before solving any question, clear all your doubts regarding its explanation with the interviewer. You could simply ask the interviewer politely to repeat the question.Prepare some questions beforehand, that you could ask the interviewer at the end of the interview.“Set daily tasks, write down all the activities you are going to do on the day, make a timeline and complete them. At the end of the day, this will give you a feeling of satisfaction and keep you motivated throughout your journey.”I hope my preparation strategy will help some of you guys in getting a good job.

These are different forms of communication, but the process of bringing them to fruition has a necessary, sometimes overlooked step: editing! Unless you’re a professional writer, it’s unlikely that you have an editor who can review your writing regularly. Here are some tips to help you review your own work.Give your writing some space. Have you ever felt a mix of pure relief and joy when you’ve finished a draft of something? Don’t downplay that feeling and the ability to walk away from your work before you start editing it. You may need minutes, hours, or days, but once you sit back down with what you originally had on the page, you’ll have the thrill of looking at it with fresh eyes. You’ll notice errors you may not have seen the first time. You’ll come to new realizations about its overall tone and structure. If it’s a text or email, maybe you only need a few minutes away from it. If it’s a story or essay, perhaps you’ll need longer. Regardless of what type of work it is, it will help your writing tremendously.Don’t use overachieving synonyms. Looking at your work for the second, third, or fourth time around may inspire you to spice up your language with longer, more uncommon words. There’s nothing wrong with having a thesaurus nearby, but try to limit the repetition of long, pretentious-feeling words so your work flows well and doesn’t feel too bogged down. At the end of the day, you want it to feel true to you and the message you’re conveying.Remember who the reader is. Don’t forget your own voice as the writer—but don’t forget who your reader is. Many writers get too close to their work; editing is a chance to try to get out of your own head. Who is your ideal reader? What do you want them to take away from the writing? It’s a unique time to step in their shoes, to make sure your communication is as effective as you’d like it to be.Kill your darlings. Don’t be scared to remove chunks of your work, even if it feels precious to you. If it’s a passage that’s really tough to part with, try saving it somewhere else, so you can return to it later in your piece or for another work.Use Grammarly. Last but not least, Grammarly has countless resources for editing your work. Our writing assistant helps you find areas of your writing that are unclear or too wordy, as well as help you find mistakes you might not have caught.Editing may feel tedious, but it’s just as important as writing itself.

First and foremost, there needs to be data, as data is strictly necessary for any machine learning. Another significant condition is that there needs to exist some underlying pattern to the data.

In order to apply machine learning to a problem, several conditions need to exist. First and foremost, there needs to be data, as data is strictly necessary for any machine learning. Another significant condition is that there needs to exist some underlying pattern to the data. This second condition is what we will look at. If there is no pattern, then applying machine learning will return a model that fits random noise, and interpreting a model of random noise is dangerous. This is primarily because although your model may fit historical data very well, especially with a complex model, it will not fit future data well without some pattern. Thus, here's my answer to your question. If you analyze your data, and you find evidence for a pattern (e.g. low validation error for a trained model by reserving some training data for validation and some data for training itself), then machine learning will definitely help. Additionally, before immediately applying your model to stock trading, I suggest you run it for awhile and measure its successes before using it to make money. Finally, remember that the stock market is a volatile entity. You will need to carefully define your approach, such as whether short term, long term, or somewhere in between trading, or other factors.\n",

At every stage, those involved tend to be vocal about what’s not working. People either feel pestered by LinkedIn recruiters or ignored when they don’t hear back after sending in an application. Once the recruiting process begins, you hear gripes about interview formats: phone-screens, whiteboarding and question types. Here’s a good example mocking the technical interview. And here’s one with numbers, proving no one knows what they’re doing anyway. One step forward... At Keepsafe, we’re always eager to improve. So when we read about how resumes don’t really provide a useful signal as to whether or not someone is a good developer, we decided to let candidates apply without resumes. We hired our Tech Lead this way, so we call that success! But then there was the next step: interviewing. An interview process is supposed to determine whether the candidate has the skills required to do the job and will be able to operate in the company culture. In Keepsafe’s case, that means assessing iOS/Android app developers. (We’re hiring app devs!) Inspired by questions from experienced hiring managers, we used to ask a set of questions on data structures, application architecture and implementing simple algorithms. We observed that many candidates didn’t answer these questions to our satisfaction — including plenty who had clearly worked on teams that successfully shipped quality mobile apps. Were we testing for the wrong things? And another… We took a month to evaluate our process and asked ourselves the following questions:What were we struggling with?Where did we believe the existing way of interviewing was falling shortWhat things should we ask more about; technically and for culture fit?What did we believe a good technical interview should accomplishWhat skills were we testing for?How could we refine the process to produce the best experience for the candidate and team?How would we evaluate candidates?As we discussed, we quickly realized that we didn’t have a clear common understanding of these requirements. We talked about what we wanted to drill into during the technical interview. We considered the personality traits we sought in candidates. We determined what to filter out during the screening process. Many questions surfaced, and this reassessment allowed everyone to contribute to the solution. What we’re looking for in app developers We challenged ourselves to list out the skills, attitudes and knowledge we believe are necessary in different technical roles for success at Keepsafe. As we discussed, we quickly found out that we didn’t have a clear, common understanding of these requirements. First, we analyzed our team’s past and present composition and acknowledged the skill-set and behaviors that were productive and those that didn’t serve the team. Next, we narrowed down criteria for a successful team member at Keepsafe. Here’s the list of abilities we’re looking for:Designs solutions taking use cases and requirement evolution into accountCommunicates clearlyReasons logicallyThinks through edge casesWeighs impact over perfectionUnderstands iOS/Android platform and limitationsLearns quicklyOpen to feedbackTeam playerWe compared how well suited our questions were to an assessment of these skills and — surprise — they didn’t match up very well. Our questions were designed with an abstract “able programmer” in mind. And while there are candidates that may solve our problem set, that didn’t mean they have the characteristics that make people thrive at Keepsafe. What’s more, when we looked closely at the skills we believed important, it became clear that they are not easily assessed by solving a technical problem alone. We decided to not only change the types of questions we ask, but to also define the kinds of answers to look for and how to interpret them. While the new process might look much like the old, how we attempt to evaluate candidates abilities is very different now. Our interview process Our phone screen is now centered on literacy. We want to know if you can write code. Can you solve a small, simple problem in a limited amount of time. For example, we may ask a candidate to write a function that reverses a string. We expect everyone to be able to solve this problem, but now we consider how fast and how much hesitation candidates have or questions the candidates raise. When we invite candidates on-site, everything is centered around a small app project that the candidate works on independently. A small project removes format limitations usually found in technical interviews. No whiteboards or other unrealistic environments used. This is about producing an app on the platform the candidate works on most (iOS or Android) and using the tools and environments they will have to employ on the job. More importantly, it provides enough specific implementation, driven by the candidate, that allows us to assess the abilities listed above. What better way to assess clear communication and reasoning than talk about the project’s implementation? We also discuss trade-off decisions made specifically for this project and can glean whether a candidate can prioritize. During the process, we can see how feedback is handled during a discussion of the project. We like to move quickly and want to make sure the candidate also will advance in Keepsafe’s environment. We’ve tested this new process for two months and have found that it truly addresses the issues we uncovered with our earlier interviews. Quizzing someone with random questions about their knowledge doesn’t get at the reason he/she wants to build cool stuff and join your company. Our revised interview process tries to create an environment more conducive to figuring this out. We’re glad to finally have an interview approach that reflects what we’re looking for and what we care about and also gives candidates a better interview experience. We’re hiring!\n",

      "True Answer: Edge computing is a delusion being propagated by the 5G marketeers suggesting that servers should sit in the data centers of mobile providers. The rationale given for this is to reduce latency. Unfortunately, there are only a few cases where this actually matters, such as gaming. And while gaming is certainly an interesting chunk of the market, it’s hard to see how that segment is going to create enough volume to affect the broader trend of cloud computing.

      "User question: What is edge computing, and how does it relate to 5G?\n",
      "Edge computing involves processing data near the source, rather than sending it back to a central cloud-based server. This can help reduce latency and improve performance for applications that require real-time decision-making or processing of large amounts of data. In contrast to traditional cloud computing, where data is processed and stored at a central location, edge computing allows applications to be run closer to the data sources, enabling faster response times and improved reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "5G refers to the fifth generation mobile communication standard, which aims to provide higher speeds, lower latencies, and more reliable connections compared to previous generations. Edge computing plays an important role in 5G by providing the necessary processing power and connectivity close to the users to support the new capabilities of the technology.\n",

Basic Programming Languages: You should know a statistical programming language, like R or Python (along with Numpy and Pandas Libraries), and a database querying language like SQL Statistics: You should be able to explain phrases like null hypothesis, P-value, maximum likelihood estimators and confidence intervals. Statistics is important to crunch data and to pick out the most important figures out of a huge dataset. This is critical in the decision-making process and to design experiments. Machine Learning: You should be able to explain K-nearest neighbors, random forests, and ensemble methods. These techniques typically are implemented in R or Python. These algorithms show to employers that you have exposure to how data science can be used in more practical manners. Data Wrangling: You should be able to clean up data. This basically means understanding that \"California\" and \"CA\" are the same thing - a negative number cannot exist in a dataset that describes population. It is all about identifying corrupt (or impure) data and and correcting/deleting them. Data Visualization: Data scientist is useless on his or her own. They need to communicate their findings to Product Managers in order to make sure those data are manifesting into real applications. Thus, familiarity with data visualization tools like ggplot is very important (so you can SHOW data, not just talk about them) Software Engineering: You should know algorithms and data structures, as they are often necessary in creating efficient algorithms for machine learning. Know the use cases and run time of these data structures: Queues, Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Trees, etc. Product Management: This one is definitely debatable, but those who understand the product are the ones who will know what metrics are the most important. There are tons of numbers one can A/B test, so product-oriented data scientist will pick the right metrics to experiment with. Know what these terms mean: Usability Testing, Wireframing, Retention and Conversion Rates, Traffic Analysis, Customer Feedback, Internal Logs, A/B Testing.\n",

The applicant must have spent a qualifying period of 10 years lawfully in the UK, for the entirety of which one or more of the following applied:(a) the applicant had permission, except permission as a Visitor, Short-term Student (English language) or Seasonal Worker (or under any of their predecessor routes); or (b) the applicant was exempt from immigration control; or (c) the applicant was in the UK as an EEA national, or the family member of an EEA national, exercising a right to reside under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 prior to 11pm on 31 December 2020 (and until 30 June 2021 or the final determination of an application under Appendix EU made by them by that date).LR 11.2. The following periods will not count towards the qualifying period for Long Residence:(a) time spent on immigration bail, temporary admission or temporary release; and (b) any period of overstaying between periods of permission before 24 November 2016 even if a further application was made within 28 days of the expiry of the previous permission; and (c) any period of overstaying between periods of permission on or after 24 November 2016 even if paragraph 39E applies to that period of overstaying; and(d) any current period of overstaying where paragraph 39E applies. LR 11.3. Subject to LR 11.4, the applicant must have had permission on their current immigration route for at least 12 months on the date of application, or have been exempt from immigration control in the 12 months immediately before the date of application. LR 11.4. If the applicant’s current permission was granted before 11 April 2024, LR 11.3. does not apply.So long as you didn’t overstay on any of your visa’s, were living continuously in the UK for the full 10 years, and meet the requirements above, then you’ll probably be able to apply.

Coding interviews are difficult because a normal programmer has not much exposure to these DSA questions in his day to day activities. I see many guys who ask coding interviews themselves struggle to solve coding interviews they have never heard before..yet they act smart in throwing a problem at a candidate and take joy in his struggle..just proving that the highly experienced engineer is just thrash… What about good design principles, good common sense coding, good system design practices.. nothing is considered and speaking of system design…wait… what do they ask…design a whatsapp. Was whatsapp designed in one hour.. comeon..the entire coding process is broken. The battle cant be won through just experience. Be it system design or coding.. u need to prepare like a part time job for atleast 6 months to even stand a chance… So, no body cares for what you worked on and what you built as part of your experience. Maybe its time to thrash writing a resume. Because end of the day, nobody will ask you what you did as part of your job.. even if they do it is just a formality.. very soon, they will say eitherhere is a array , rotate it clockwise… ordesign a collaborative text editorWhat if i say, in my experience i never got to roate an array and i never claimed i designed a collaborative text editor. out i go. Wait, i never claimed either in my resume. What about the rest ful services i have built. What about the challenges i faced and how i solved them. Why are the interviewers not interested in those. The interviewers can ask me why i use a particular service in favour of other alternatives. they can twist my case and ask other intutive questions. No, then already have a toy problem for me(for coding) and a mega publicly famous software design that toook people years to design and implement What is the point of writing a resume then? It is a pity that we have to prepare for an interview like a part time job. Apart from handling the stress of our job, preparing for interview is a very hard stressful process.

You want a manner of statement that fully shows how to identify the working terms and how to program them, such as through exact examples in syntax and defining how the process works. You also want to show an example program in which to use the process, because programmers are employed for that purpose.

Fintech, however, takes that to another level. As a booming industry that is continually changing legacy institutions by disruption and the rapid pace of evolution, financial technologies need people to fuel the progress. The interest in the industry is at its highest at the moment, and there is little surprise that many people want to land a job offer in this sphere. Whether one is aiming solely at monetary benefits (which is fine), wants to join the process of shaping the future of finances or find a spot to reach the maximum personal development score — fintech is a fine place to start looking for a vacant position. Here’s how Joblift visualizes the positive dynamic of UK’s fintech job market (alongside some salary numbers) in comparison to traditional banking positions.Image source: UK’s fintech and traditional banking job markets The monetary benefits seem obvious. And the thought of possibly changing the future technology is somewhat romantic as well. It’s time to divide the job market into segments and explain what exactly the industry needs at the moment. Hard Skills Are At The Top Of FinTech’s Demands It won’t be a surprise to find out that the industry that’s driving innovation in the financial segment will require a lot of talent with solid hard skills. Programmers, designers, hardware engineers and more — there’s a lot of room for activity. Traditional programming tops IT jobs in fintech segment Regardless of the niche and industry, some good old code writing is required pretty much everywhere, fintech included. The programmers can find their skill set useful for various projects, from basic to the most complex ones. Here’s a list of the most common tasks for programmers:Website development (Full Stack)App developmentApp maintenanceUI/UX design and implementationProduct APIsThe list can shrink or grow depending on the region, company and its activity sphere, but you get the general picture. Based on your skill and experience, you can land a job that would guarantee anything from $80,000 to $100,000 a year and beyond, when taking the US market into account. If you’re new to programming and have mastered front-end development, your services will be required. If you are skilled enough for more complex issues, fintech is full of platforms that need to be maintained and APIs to create. AI and Machine Learning jobs get more popular among employers Fintech has accelerated the means to acquire, analyze and utilize the data from countless sources. Artificial intelligence helps to navigate and find the required information, allowing a more comfortable life for data scientists. However, they must know how to operate and train the AI. Fintech is ready to pay around 25% more for data science experts than other industries, which makes it an excellent choice with those knowledgeable about AIs and training patterns. The cost-effectiveness trends demand a better conversion of acquired data. Petabytes of information must be thoroughly examined to provide a unique user experience for each customer, thus increasing ROI. The specialist would have to be proficient at data science toolkits and visualization tools, alongside query languages and NoSQL databases. Each position will demand their own unique set of skills, but the general picture outlines precisely these requirements. Automation is what takes fintech’s processes to another level The original idea of fintech was to deliver better results for less time while cutting costs and offering unique value to the client. All that had to come from new technology. But as each business model can be improved, so can be the technology. Automation engineers will need to tackle the core of the company and find ways to make it work faster and comply with the original requirements we mentioned in the previous paragraph. Some positions may combine automation with AI, Deep Learning and Machine Learning, taking it solely to the data analysis niche. Regardless, an employee that knows how to make the processes more efficient and consume fewer resources, would be an invaluable addition to any team. Cybersecurity is a necessity for most fintech companies This skill (although it is nearly impossible to specify the technologies or qualifications that are common or general) is the door to institutions like startups and government facilities at the same time. A study by Accenture shows that financial organizations are the ones to suffer the most from cybercrime, with total costs sitting at $18 million for 2017.Image source: Cost Of Cyber Crime For Financial Services The damage dealt to other industries by cybercriminals is equally staggering, meaning that a cybersecurity expert can easily expect to find a job in any of the spheres mentioned above. Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers as the new trend for financial services Probably the talk of the decade, blockchain is discussed by countless experts, yet much fewer can make it work for the particular environment. An expert with blockchain knowledge will be asked to build platforms for money transfer (both crypto and fiat), smart contracts, advanced data management and so forth. A skilled blockchain developer can secure a deal that pays from $100,000 to $250,000 annually, although we were unable to find a solid proof for the latter figure. Soft skills get more value for most IT jobs While there’s a substantial list of what you can do to succeed in fintech, the nature of the industry demands that you have your soft skills well-developed. Fintech originated from the spirit of innovation and versatility, brought to the business by startups, and the soft skills of the employees are given huge importance on a daily basis. Here are some that one would most likely encounter in most of the fintech job ads:Openness. As a manager, you have to be as open with other employees as possible. As a developer or engineer, the same thing is always preferable. An open person can communicate better, seek assistance faster and thus deal with problems far more efficiently than a guy who likes to do everything by himself.Problem-solving. An employee solves a ton of issues on a daily basis, one may say. This concept, however, circulates the mentality. An employee must be proactive and seek opportunities to improve on existing results. Quick thinking is a crucial part of problem-solving, as it allows no time for hesitation or panic — only determination and cold analysis of the destination.Communication. A derivative of openness. It means how well the person integrates with the team both on and off the actual working process. Communication allows more efficient collaboration of the departments and teams, thus granting bigger benefits at the end. It is imperative to build strong bonds within the team, so each employee is ready to take on any challenge for themselves and for “that guy next to them.”Transparency throughout the organization. A concept that applies more towards managerial staff. The age of startups made traditional management obsolete. Nobody will appreciate secrecy, or worse treatment just based on position. Today’s mentality is about CEOs being equal to junior developers on a human level. When managers are openly discussing casual stuff or project details with everyone else despite their position, it creates a bond within the team that is highly beneficial for the company.Adaptability. The atmosphere and workflow of a startup inevitably mean issues that one will need to tackle regardless of their skill or position. Versatility and ability to adapt is critical for an employee to move further up the career ladder within startups or other highly digital environments.\n",

Trust me, I realized this late - I did do one course by andrew Ng before I went for offline class. Anyway, there are many people who have even structure DS curriculum for themselves - that will be helpful. Otherwise, just you yourself can write down topics you need to cover ( from courses on DS, job descriptions, self made data scientists etc. ) Then next step is to find suitable resources. I felt some courses are good in one aspect but may not be so clear in some others. But, do try some resources yourself and go for paid courses once you feel you need extra help from someone. Or ! you can do a paid course for the certificate, sure.Highly recommend Khan Academy for maths. Statistics, probabily, matrices etc are very very useful tools for data visualizations, analysis and inferences. I thought python was what I should master! But now I think python is just a tool, you can still program googling and referring documentations, but the maths part ! is what helps in the analysis and understanding. most courses on Ml, DL etc don’t touch on the maths portion that well. Khan Academy’s course was super - like teaching a baby. They teach with graphs from the beginning. I can’t recommend it enough!Analytics Vidya is a great resource. They offer course too (paid) - I don’t know how thats like, but their website content is good so the course ought to be good toO I think.Another resource is Siraj Raval. And even better, he has already made curriculum lists ! for data science, deep learning, ML and a few others. You can follow his channel to stay up to date, motivated etc.Try data camp for programming part. They also have a data science career track - which I am trying out now. But, anyway, I have tried their python course and it was good. So you can learn python there.I have also realized that adding projects to your github is very important even for internships. So start working on small projects. Kaggle is a very good place to get data sets and experiment and y favourite part is that they provide kernels to work from. I am still on the quest to find good resources for certain cases.I also found this answer on quora today which I am eager to try out ! Good luck\n",

      "True Answer: As someone who has bet his career on it, I definitely believe in a bright future of natural language processing. NLP is a big part of what we do at Coseer (Coseer - Welcome!) - automate tedious cognitive tasks in businesses. The fundamental thesis is that human beings think, communicate and understand necessarily in an unstructured and subjective way.

On the other hand, the decision science is binary (or quantified). \"The weather is nice today.\" meanContinue ReadingAs someone who has bet his career on it, I definitely believe in a bright future of natural language processing. NLP is a big part of what we do at Coseer (Coseer - Welcome!) - automate tedious cognitive tasks in businesses. The fundamental thesis is that human beings think, communicate and understand necessarily in an unstructured and subjective way. The same sentence e.g. \"The weather is nice today.\" comes up with different imagery, thoughts, memories, and decision trees for different people. On the other hand, the decision science is binary (or quantified). \"The weather is nice today.\" means nothing to it. It needs to know the temperature, solar insolation, humidity, cloud coverage, etc. As a result, all workflows in personal or business domains are either entirely human - in which case it is very difficult to automate or scale them - or they involve a human layer that converts the real world inputs to computer inputs. To continue with our example, some human must have told Siri that if, in San Francisco, cloud coverage is less than 20% and temperature is more than 70F, call that a nice day. Clearly same rules do not apply for Byrd Station in Antarctica, where a day like this pretty much predicts the end of the world. For businesses the problem is much more complex. Think of the investor who scrambles to read enough blogs before making a buy/sell decision, or the marketer who has to scourge through as many websites as possible before deciding which products to promote, or the health care professional who has to input 1,000s of unstructured transcripts everyday to ensure that proper medication is dispensed and appropriate protocols are being followed, and so forth. NLP based cognitive computing comes smack in the middle of solving these problems, and the potential is limitless. In fact I am also willing to wager that cognitive computing will be the major use case for quantum computing as it develops in the next decade. Armed with a tool like that cognitive computing can fundamentally change the world. In any case, this is from a believer, so please take it with a pinch of salt.\n",

In comparison with countries like the Scandinavians, this concern is practically non-existent. They also have very strong unions and we don’t, but that is another topic. Most businesses focus on hiring individuals that will produce the most with the least amount of problems. That would mean the higher the stress is in the industry, the more they would screen individuals carefully for issues. One of the issues here is that we have many very large businesses. The larger the business in terms of employees, the less capability it will have to deal with individual mental health issues. That is a nebulous answer for you.

Facebook was a very long time ago so I don’t think my experience is relevant any more, but all my discussion was with my recruiter who had full authority to tell me yes or no (she said yes). I also got to change the wording of my employment contract, though this was on Facebook’s initiative as a courtesy to me, not an actual demand (basContinue ReadingI’ve negotiated my compensation for both Google and Facebook. Facebook was a very long time ago so I don’t think my experience is relevant any more, but all my discussion was with my recruiter who had full authority to tell me yes or no (she said yes). I also got to change the wording of my employment contract, though this was on Facebook’s initiative as a courtesy to me, not an actual demand (basically they put in writing that they will never refuse me taking time off or requesting remote work to visit my family). For Google it was a bit different, as the hiring process goes through several formal checks, hiring committee, VP approval etc. so my recruiter didn’t have the final say. I don’t think I got every penny I could have had from Google and what I got was something of a pyrrhic victory, though on paper it looked much better than my original offer. I got an offer to start in December 2019, with X salary, Y equity and 0 starting bonus. X and Y were pretty decent numbers and well within my expectations. My recruiter explained I would be in the middle of the band for my hiring level (which was staff engineer / L6), and once I joined I verified this was the case as many employees share their salaries internally. I thought it would be hard to ask for a higher salary or a higher equity but I felt that there was no harm in asking for a starting bonus. After all, if I started then I was not going to forgo my bonus at my current employer. So, I asked for a 50k starting bonus. My recruiter couldn’t give me 50k herself, so she had to send back my offer and wait for an answer. It came within a week or so and it was granted. That’s the least I’ve ever worked for 50,000 dollars. But then, the time was a ticking and did I really want to start in the 2nd half of December 2019, while presumably everyone would be away? It didn’t make a ton of sense, plus, I had a big deadline for the first week of January so was already thinking of starting mid January, after taking a little bit of time off. I told my recruiter as well, so she could finish my offer letter. Good news, she told me, X USD was if you started in 2019, but since you’re starting in 2020, we’re revising our scales and you’re getting like a 3% raise. Great - I still haven’t done any type of work for Google, and I already got 50k and a 3% bump. So I signed and started to work and off I was for my first year, then pandemic happened as we all know which just made my ramping up more difficult. Tech companies in general are better at onboarding remote folks but Google, which was very much an everybody must come to the office every day type of company, had a rough start. I was doing ok but not great, and I was thinking that if I had another 6 weeks at the office - starting early December with everyone versus mid January, it would have made a pretty big difference.

      "True Answer: Vikram Ahuja, co-founder of Talent500, a company which helps technology and shared service center in India with their recruitment, says they have seen an increase of more than 60% in women applying for technology roles since work-fromhome (WHF) started last year. This includes data from the IT/ITeS sector, from startups, and from global capability centres (GCCs), which are the tech and shared services centres of MNCs in India. “With remote work being the new norm, more companies have started offering greater degrees of flexibility of location and work timings,” says Ahuja.We have seen an increaContinue ReadingVikram Ahuja, co-founder of Talent500, a company which helps technology and shared service center in India with their recruitment, says they have seen an increase of more than 60% in women applying for technology roles since work-fromhome (WHF) started last year. This includes data from the IT/ITeS sector, from startups, and from global capability centres (GCCs), which are the tech and shared services centres of MNCs in India. “With remote work being the new norm, more companies have started offering greater degrees of flexibility of location and work timings,” says Ahuja.We have seen an increase of more than 60% in women applying for technology roles since work-from-home started last year. This includes data from IT/ITeS, start-ups and global capability centres (GCC). Vikram Ahuja, co-founder, Talent500 This flexibility is a big boon especially for women. Many women have to choose between their career and their family, and end up leaving the workforce after marriage or after having a baby. This has created a massive gender imbalance at the middle and top levels of companies. Technology companies have in recent years created platforms to help bring such women back into the workforce. But in terms of sheer impact, none of those can probably beat WFH – which was initially forced by the pandemic, but which many companies now say will be an integral part of their future workspace policy. Talent500 started a six-week bootcamp called TakeTwo earlier this year, designed to help women technologists return to the workforce. The company says it received applications from 300 women for a batch size of just 13. ‘We are trying to create a special programme for women, which starts before the final interview, so that the chances of going through the funnel are higher. The process has resulted in women from even Rajkot and Indore applying and looking to work with us.” - said by Ashish Grover, CIO, Falabella Chilean retailer Falabella, which has a high-end technology centre in India, has partnered with Talent500 for the programme. “Work from home and a cut down in travel has really created a good opportunity for women,” says Ashish Grover, CIO of Falabella. “We are trying to create a special programme to bring women back. The process has resulted in women from even Rajkot and Indore applying and looking to work with us. Most of the roles are for full-stack developers,” he says. Shweta R, who is working from Guna in Madhya Pradesh, is among those who went through the TakeTwo programme, and who has been hired by a global airline company as a full-stack developer. She says the best part of the job is that she can be close to her family and support them, “while focusing on my role without the need of daily commutes and being physically present in the office.” US financial technology company Fiserv, which has a big centre in India, says they have always had a focus on hiring women, but the pandemic has brought such opportunities to centrestage. Last year, the company piloted a program called Forward for Her, to help women return to work after a career break. It received over 250 applications for multiple technology fields, of which 40% of applicants were progressed and over 10% were offered opportunities with skill sets in Mainframe and JAVA. The second edition of the programme was launched last month. “We have received an overwhelming response with many queries and applications coming through various channels including associate referrals,” says Srini Krish, president at Fiserv. We have always had the focus and deliberation (to hire women), but the pandemic has brought such opportunities to centrestage. Our Forward for Her programme received over 250 applications for multiple technology fields - Said by Srini Krish, president, global services, Fiserv Ahuja says a big advantage of the WFH option is the broadening of the talent pool, which has made it easier for companies to get the right talent. “So many people have left big cities like Bengaluru and are working from their hometowns. That is why companies are reaching out to these smaller places. For women, this is a particularly good opportunity. Firms can also negotiate a salary based on the living standards of the city. It is a win-win for both,” he says. Lokendra Sethi, HR head at DXC Technolog, agrees that WFH opens up more roles for women. Anshuman Ray, head of human resources at semiconductor tools company Synopsys, says they recently hired two mid-career women in Pune and Kolkata. “This would not have been done earlier, as we do not have a base location there. If we need innovation, it is a no brainer that we need more women, and the pandemic has given us a little bit of push in that direction. Why miss out on a wider talent pool which can contribute to the business?” he asks. We recently hired two mid-career women in Pune and Kolkata This would not have been done earlier, as we do not have a base location there - said by Anshuman Ray, director, human resources, Synopsys Synopsys has two programmes to take women back into its fold. One is called the Maternal Buddy programme, which handholds employees who are returning after a maternity break. The other, Reignite Your Aspirations (RYA), was started earlier this year, and tracks women who might have taken a sabbatical for some reason, and seeks to bring them back after some training. It has already helped bring some women back.\n",

There has been implicit preparation, in the form of education, experience, and ongoing continuous improvement, but no studying/cramming for the interview. The preparation for the interviews I’ve had has always been limited to showing up with the actual knowledge and experience I had gained prior to the interview. In other words, there was no last-minute, last-week, or last-month studying/cramming. I arrived at the interviews ready to discuss and demonstrate what I know, what I have done, what I can do, how well I can adapt and learn, how well I can communicate, and enough humility to accept that I don’t know everything and that there will always be new things to learn and there will always be room for improvement. I have never studied web sites or books containing technical interview questions/topics/answers. My performance in interviews has been based on the knowledge, skill, and experience I brought to the table at the time. I have never believed that studying/cramming for a technical interview was a good idea. The preparation should be the knowledge, skill, and experience you actually have prior to the interview, and not a set of questions/topics/answers you studied explicitly for the interview. Prior jobs, prior projects, prior education, and continuously working to hone your craft — this is the preparation that really counts.

Be sure to research the company's coding style and ask relevant questions beforehand to demonstrate your knowledge.\n",
      "2. Soft Skills Interviews - This section focuses on assessing your communication skills, teamwork abilities, time management skills, adaptability, and problem-solving ability. You should practice answering common interview questions like \"Tell me about yourself\" and \"Why do you want to work for our company?\" and research examples of how soft skills are demonstrated in the workplace.\n",
      "3. Behavioral Interviews - Behavioral interviews (also known as case studies) test your ability to solve complex problems under real-world conditions. They often involve hypothetical scenarios or past experiences where you had to make decisions or overcome challenges. Research examples of successful behavior-based interview questions and prepare answers for such types of questions.\n",

      "6. Parallel programming techniques: Leveraging multithreading or parallel processing techniques allows applications to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, thereby reducing overall execution time.\n",
      "7. Database indexing: Properly indexing database tables can significantly reduce query time and optimize database performance.\n",
      "8. Reducing communication overhead: Minimizing data transfer between client and server components reduces latency and improves system performance.\n",
      "9. Using caching strategies: Caching frequently accessed data can drastically reduce the number of round-trips required for retrieval, thus improving overall system performance.\n",

      "True Answer: There are three things you want to optimize for in your first PM job: exposure, mentorship and association with successful companies. Exposure - In your first job you want to get as much exposure as possible to core product management functions, types of products/technology, and functional teams the PMs tend to interact with (engineering, sales, marketing, finance, executive teams, client service, etc). This will give you great context for how things work in many different areas—a fantastic asset to have early in your PM career.Big companies tend to win in this category IF you get access to theContinue ReadingThere are three things you want to optimize for in your first PM job: exposure, mentorship and association with successful companies. Exposure - In your first job you want to get as much exposure as possible to core product management functions, types of products/technology, and functional teams the PMs tend to interact with (engineering, sales, marketing, finance, executive teams, client service, etc). This will give you great context for how things work in many different areas—a fantastic asset to have early in your PM career.Big companies tend to win in this category IF you get access to these different areas. Understanding how much you'll actually interact with these different areas is key. Even if your scope is somewhat narrow you still probably are better off in a bigger company.Small companies have fewer products and fewer people with deep specialization a, which doesn't allow you to learn how all the different functional areas fit together (an important trait for PMs). That said you'll probably have access to everyone in the company and have the opportunity to do tasks you'd never get in a big Co.Mentorship - This is the number one thing I'd optimize for your first PM role. How skillful and experienced is the person you'll be reporting to? Do they seem inclined to mentor you? In my career, this was the single biggest factor in my development as a PM and should be high on your list.I think big and small companies can be on level playing fields here. You really just need to get to know your prospective boss during the interview process and make a judgement call.One word of caution! Definitely avoid being the only product person in a small company as a junior PM. Product is a very nuanced role that requires a certain level of mastery before you’ll likely to succeed as a solo PM. I learned this one the hard way! :)Assocation with Successful Companies - While being associated with success doesn't mean you’re actually a better PM, it does affect the way others view you and your future opportunities. As irrational as the halo effect is—it is still very real.Big companies tend to have the advantage here since there is less risk of them failing.Startups on the other hand have the potential to both help or hurt your career on this particular issue—its just impossible to predict in the early stages. They’re probably not worth the extra risk for your first PM role unless you plan to spend your career working in startups anyways.A final consideration A lot depends on where you want to spend your career. If you want to be in small companies, then it may be worth taking your chances and joining a small company. That's actually what I did (despite the extra risk). If you think you might like bigger companies start there and you can always move down to a smaller company in the future. When I started out as a PM I interviewed with both big and small companies and evaluated each opportunity on its own merits. That approach worked really well for me.\n",

Additionally, small companies may have a more agile and flexible culture that can be beneficial for someone looking to grow their skill set. However, this does not mean that working at a large company would necessarily hinder your growth. In fact, some of the largest companies in the world have been successful by building strong teams from smaller companies.

A good PM must sincerely understand the customers' pain points and deliver products or solutions that meet or hopefully exceeds their expectation. A great PM builds products that address pain points the customer hasn't even identified themselves.Critical thinking is the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue to form a judgment. A good PM remains objective when evaluating a situation and is often \"data-informed\" but not \"data-driven,\" as past behaviors may not predict how future customers will react. A great PM knows how to balance critical thinking and data insights with a touch of instinct to assess a situation and make decisions.Leadership is the action of leading a group of people or an organization. Although a PM does not usually have a large group of direct reports, they often lead and give direction to an extended team of developers, program managers, product designers, and many others. As a result, they must inspire a team they have no authority over to give their best to meet a deadline, deliver a product, and innovate.

Additionally to your base salary you will get a bi-annual bonus (amount depending on your performance and your level) and stock (again, amount depending on your level and performance). My total annual salary (including stock and bonus) exceeds 300,000 US$. With 3-4 years of experience you will probably be hired at level E4. You may also get offered to join as an E5. Don't be blindsided by the higher compensation. Expectations differ significantly between E4 and E5 and I've seen multiple people hired at E5 fail to live up to them. Being hired at E4 will allow you to ramp up more easily, perform better and get a promotion within the first 12 to 18 months. This will set you up much better to progress your career than being hired at E5 and having multiple weak or disappointing performance cycles.\n",

      "True Answer: As a female programmer, I cannot resist the temptation to answer (in a long rambling way). Some of the issues I have seen with women in programming are these: 1. Lack of role models. On the average you see very few female programmers who have stuck with it for more than 10 years.

Some of the issues I have seen with women in programming are these: 1. Lack of role models. On the average you see very few female programmers who have stuck with it for more than 10 years. Given the small number, it is hard to find mentors/friends you want to hang out with and learn from. The other important thing is, you want to have everything a great male programmer wants to have, plus what you were raised to aspire to have as a woman. These things are sometimes off on tangents, and that makes it hard to reconcile. 2. Being mentored out of programming. On the average a female programmer is usually better at being social than her male counterparts. This makes them more obvious targets, from a manager's perspective, to be groomed into managers or product managers. A common problem seems to be that most engineering managers of either gender have no idea how to manage women. So the women who get promoted to manage engineering teams pick up the same skills and tend to behave very much like the managers they had worked with in the past. 3. Not working on personal projects. Never in any of the personal (non-work, non-school) programming projects, have I ever worked with a female programmer. This is a very common thing to do with good male programmers. But very rarely done by women outside of school/work. And is pretty much the best way to improve your skills as a programmer. 4. Negative stereotyping. Let's say you get an intern for the summer. If it's a male programmer, the default assumption always is he is a good programmer and would be fine with setting up his own machine, RAID, whatnot. But a female programmer has to prove she can do each thing, before someone will accept that she can. This probably means, you will not get a \"harder\" problem to solve at the very beginning of your career. 5. Different motivations. Most of the exceptional male programmers I know are motivated by completely different things than the female programmers I know. Women tend to look at programming as a way to solve a certain problem - if the problem is interesting, they will work to get it done. Men, while being motivated by the problem also seem to enjoy the mechanics of how the program works. They are just as excited about additional L1 cache, a 13% performance/memory improvement or the number of pipelines in the latest graphics processor than women are. To understand this, look at the most successful startups started by women and the ones started by men. I have put together and pulled apart every bit of a computer at least a thousand times, at work. But I did not really go and buy parts to put together a PC at home. I bought a Macbook :P 6. Social Pressure. I will probably get yelled out of the forum for saying this. But, being a female programmer does not make you the most attractive thing in the universe. You have to be attractive despite the fact, if you are, at all. Wealth, social stature, etc., work wonders for a male programmer. If you are not socially accepted in high school, you can work really hard and make it as an ubergeek and the trappings that come along with it will make you attractive. Not really how it works for women. It is really cool to be hi-5ed for debugging something and being told \"You are the man!\". But the thrill of that gets old pretty soon. 7. Wanting to fit in with the female population in general. When you spend so much time in places that have less than 10% women, it warps your perspective of the world. Most female programmers have probably been in such a setting since they were in their teens (highschool, college, grad school, jobs etc). You tend to end up having way more male friends, and slowly stop doing things most women enjoy. You are militantly trying to be more ungirly than you are really comfortable with, at least for the first few years as a programmer. (On the flip side, this does make it really amazing to meet other female programmers.) I must also add: I got my first computer in 4th grade. Punched in BASIC to get pretty pixels on the screen etc. But that did not get me the kind of high some other people I know seemed to have gotten out of it. Also, I was raised in a culture where being geeky was not the worst thing in the world. But still, I did not I make up my mind to be a programmer until I was 17 - primarily motivated by Bill Gates, wanting to start a company. CS has the lowest barrier if you want to start your own business, compared to many other fields. The age of first exposure to programming is not such a big deal. I have met guys who pick up their first programming language at 18 and were doing amazing things with it in a year or two. To be clear, the internet, has changed everything. The way people learn to program and find friends. So a lot of things would be very different for a young girl starting out right now.\n",

      "True Answer: Processing varies a lot by country, when you apply and how complex your application is. Priority service does not guarantee it will be processed faster, only that it will be put on the top of the queue.

The processing time may also depend on whether you choose to pay the fee upfront or wait for payment before submitting the application.

Once the fee is paid, the processing time typically starts from the date of payment, and it could take only a few hours or even minutes for the UK Visa Application Centre to start processing your application. This fast processing time can help you expedite the process and reduce any potential delays caused by backlogs or other issues. However, please note that some applications require additional fees or further processing steps beyond the UK Priority Service, so it is best to confirm with the UK Visa Application\n",

Do you know about the .com bubble that increased the price of internet companies shares? What happened then was everyone was trying to have their .com website and then raising money and then eventually we all know what happened… I believe that somewhat similar thing is going to happen now also. A lot of people started doing computer science… in 2021, over hiring happen (due to US Fed Bank lowering interest rates).. chain effect… more people entered software field. I believe this bubble equivalent to dot-com bubble will burst soon. Do you know that in the past only kings used to rule people… then came stock market which gave common people some power… then came this democracy that gives people more power… then business… now startups… and then finally VCs… You realised that doing something of your own is getting easier and easier day by day… I believe that similar thing is happening in the coding jobs.. Earlier people used to code in some tougher languages.. then c came.. better… then CPP… even better… then Java… then python… best… software creation became easier day by day… The similar trend can be observed for coding jobs. Things are getting easier for the masses, earlier only celebrities can became popular… then came YouTube and Instagram, that made normal people famous.. The similar thing will happen for software making that there will be AI tools in the future that can create complete end to end softwares in just minutes killing the software dev. jobs.Things are becoming easier for normal peopleso is the software development, and AI will be it's pioneer.Recently, Scott Wu lead Cognition Labs unveiled their Devin AI, that can create complete end to end software for you. ChatGPT and Devin AI are just beginning, more advanced tools will come eventually that will kills most of tech. jobs. Now don't tell me ki AI sab kucch kar sakta hai… well I also said this.. but imagine a person placed with Amazon just fixing bugs? wtf eventually believe it or not you'll hear job losses. Now what to do? First of all let me tell you we only observe negative side of things ki technology se job jayegi… but what about those jobs jo ki technology ki wajah se create ho Rahi hai like Prompt engineering, Data Science related jobs.. there will be options in the future.Only specialised & skilled people will stay in the jobWell, I can write more.. but this already became lengthy… There are just my views. Again, there are my predictions based on the history. Bye… thanks for reading….\n",

      "Question: Startup salary negotiation. How do I negotiate a competitive salary at a bootstrapped startup?\n",
      "True Answer: Most startups are acquired using some kind of formula that is supposed to determine its worth. In SaaS, that usually looks something like 5–10x revenue. And then you see these startups that are acquired at ridiculous multiples of revenue. Youtube is a particularly outrageous one—acquired at 1.65 BILLION revenues of only $15 million.That is what we like to call a strategic acquisition. (I promise I’ll get to the point here 😂) 100x revenue is an absolute head-in-the-clouds number. If any startup founder with 15m in revenue told you they want over a 100x multiplier on revenue, you’d laugh them out Continue ReadingMost startups are acquired using some kind of formula that is supposed to determine its worth. In SaaS, that usually looks something like 5–10x revenue. And then you see these startups that are acquired at ridiculous multiples of revenue. Youtube is a particularly outrageous one—acquired at 1.65 BILLION revenues of only $15 million.That is what we like to call a strategic acquisition. (I promise I’ll get to the point here 😂) 100x revenue is an absolute head-in-the-clouds number. If any startup founder with 15m in revenue told you they want over a 100x multiplier on revenue, you’d laugh them out of town. But that’s what Youtube got. WAY more than they’re worth “on paper”. Google acquired Youtube on a basis of strategy, not revenue. They had a feeling Youtube was going to be huge. They weren’t wrong. Youtube brought in 15 billion in revenue in 2019. When it comes to joining a company, that’s what you want. You want to prove to the leadership team that’s hiring you that you’re a strategic hire. As soon as you let them put a formula on you, you’re done. For example… “We have this marketing position. We can get someone online to do these tasks for $30/hr, but we want someone in house. $30*40 hrs*52 is $62,400, so that is what we’re offering you”. That’s a number that’s tied to your hourly worth. You might be able to prove that you’re worth $40hr, but you’re still playing small. Here are a couple ways you can flip the game on it’s head:You have relevant, unique experience in the industry. Maybe you’ve even worked for the competition. Or you have some kind of insight in their space that would be extremely hard and rare to find. That makes you more of a unicorn.You can point to performance numbers that show how much upside you can create for the company. This is a value based pitch rather than an expense based pitch. You could show them exactly how you plan to do thisYou have assets that nobody else does—huge connections, a big social media following, etc—showing to the leadership team that you can “take them places” the second you are hired. You can help put them on the map.Now the actual negotiation here is tricky because the startup isn’t made of money. So how can you create the most possible upside for yourself? Get some skin in the game. Most startup people absolutely love this! It shows that you’re one of them. You’re a risk/reward player. It’s a solid move that lets you ask for more without breaking too much rapport.Ask for a plan that’s heavily incentive based. Remember the second bullet above about creating upside for the company? Well, if you can create X amount of money for the company, what would that be worth to them? It shows you’re confident you can perform, gives you some skin in the game, and significant upside if you can show up.Most startups are low on cash, but they can offset that with equity. Just make sure you ask a ton of questions about how exactly that equity works. They’ll like that you’re willing to take equity and there can still be strong upside in it for you.A lot of these strategies are things I’ve worked on personally to help create a win/win with the different startups I’ve worked in. Startup is a crazy world. If I’ve learned one thing, it’s that for those of us who are 1) willing to take on risk and 2) actually show up and crush it… it’s a world filled with massive opportunity.Thanks for reading! 🙂\n",

      "When starting your career in web development, it's important to choose a path that aligns with your interests and strengths. There are many different roles within the field, including front-end, back-end, and full-stack development. Each role has its own unique set of skills and responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Front-end developers work primarily with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other client-side technologies to create interactive UI elements on websites. They use frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build complex applications. Front-end developers also collaborate closely with designers to ensure a seamless user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back-end developers, on the other hand, focus on server-side programming languages such as Python, Java, PHP, or Ruby. They develop backend logic for applications and databases, ensuring secure data storage and retrieval. Back-end developers often write server-side code using frameworks like Django, Express.js, or Ruby on Rails.\n",

      "Full-stack developers take advantage of both front-end and back-end knowledge by building entire applications from scratch. These professionals have strong problem-solving abilities and can work efficiently across multiple technical areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choosing which path to follow depends on individual preferences and goals. If you prefer working directly with clients and designing interactive experiences, a front-end role might be more suitable for you. However, if you enjoy coding algorithms and managing large systems, a back-end position could offer greater flexibility and challenge. Finally, full-stack development offers an all-encompassing approach where you can leverage your expertise in both frontend and backend technologies.\n",

Let’s look at the only other answer:Joseph: Any AI inherently is biased to being able to better answer certain questions than others, this is mathematically proven.Correct.Joseph: The idea of AGI is based on the idea that humans have “general intelligence”,True.Joseph: but that is just an illusion produced by the fact we are human and thus don’t see our specializations as being specializations.No, it actually has a theoretical foundation.Joseph: I think the idea is not only non-viable, but inherently nonsensical. What people want is human-like AI, which I think is sillyIt is silly since no AI can do that. Actual AGI theory is not derived from or based on computational theory. These are quite different.Joseph: Anyway, we aren’t even close to human-like AI as we simply don’t know enough about human cognition to be able to replicate it.This is what I work on everyday.

      "True Answer: Here is the five-step process if you want to get your first job into a product management role (this is valid for freshers looking for their first job or people who want to transition from tech, marketing, sales, etc. to product manager role). But first, let me tell you what you shouldn’t do: “Do not rely on applying through job portals such as Linkedin, Naukri, AngelList, etc, and expecting HRs to call you. There are hundreds of people applying for the same role, so HRs use many biased filters such as college, years of experience, brand names etc. to reduce the number of candidates for the roleContinue ReadingHere is the five-step process if you want to get your first job into a product management role (this is valid for freshers looking for their first job or people who want to transition from tech, marketing, sales, etc. to product manager role). But first, let me tell you what you shouldn’t do: “Do not rely on applying through job portals such as Linkedin, Naukri, AngelList, etc, and expecting HRs to call you. There are hundreds of people applying for the same role, so HRs use many biased filters such as college, years of experience, brand names etc. to reduce the number of candidates for the role. If you are a fresher, chances are you will likely be filtered out here only.” The product management roles have become very popular these days, hence you will face a lot of competition while searching for the first job. Now coming to the 5 steps to get your first job as a product manager: Step 1: Learn product management: Yes if you do not have knowledge of the fundamental skills of a product manager then no company would want to hire you. Have a good understanding of user research, execution, wireframing, problem-solving, and communication. You can follow a structured course or curriculum to crack this, it should take you around 2 months to do this well. (You’ll be ahead of 80% of candidates if you do this well) Step 2: Choose the industry you want to work in: Based on your educational background, work experience, or interest, pin-point a sector to work on. It could be ed-tech, fin-tech, food-tech, health-tech, SAAS, crypto, or anything. Do thorough research of all the happenings of this industry, you can use a framework such as a porter 5 forces to do this (you’ll study such frameworks in Step 1). Step 3: Make a list of about 20 companies in that sector where you would want to work: You can find these companies via quick google search, LinkedIn, naukri.com, angel list, etc. It will be much better if these companies are mid-sized so that you can reach out to decision-makers directly via email. Step 4: Add value: Suppose that you were a product manager at these companies, how would you help them in your first three months? Do a product tear down, do some user research, add market research, and build a solid case of how you can add value to the product. Create a well-written guide or presentation (If you could create MVPs that would be much better.). (Do DM me if you need a template/idea of what to create). Put all your efforts and learning here. If you have done Steps 1 and 2 wholeheartedly then you will do a great job in this step. Step 5: Reach out to the company’s decision-makers with your analysis: Now find emails of decision-makers in the company (CEO, CPO, CTO, etc.) and send them your analysis (Done in Step 4) along with a good introduction and why you are passionate about working with them. Step 6: Repeat for other companies: Now follow up with these people up to three times (because busy people can actually miss things), and iterate this process to other companies in the list. I can assure you that if you put in enough efforts, you are likely to get replies from many of them. Why this method works? This method works because in your analysis you will showcase all of the skills that a product manager is supposed to have (which cannot be assured from a resume), this will reduce the risk of a wrong hire. This will also get you a good understanding of the industry which is a very important thing people look for in product managers. This indicates that you are a self-starter and take ownership (you did analysis by yourself and reached out to them), which again is a must-have skill for product management roles. This indicates that you are actually passionate about working at the company as you might have invested so many hours in doing the analysis.This method is proven to be successful but I am sure less than 1% of aspiring product managers are going to go through this (because it's a lot of hard work). I hope this will help you get your first job as a product manager. In case you need any help or advice, messaging me is never a bad idea. You can find me on LinkedIn here. Thanks.\n",

      "True Answer: Name recognition goes a long ways when building your career. Many developers, especially developers in the first half of their career, are excited by doing new things. While money is a motivator, most developers are less entrepreneurial and more focused on building interesting software. FAANG companies have a culture around progress and growth, whereas the financial services industry is about stability/predictability. FAANG company culture can be more dynamic and entertaining than working with “boring old banks”. There is also a lot of hype around FAANG that projects an image developers desire.Continue ReadingName recognition goes a long ways when building your career. Many developers, especially developers in the first half of their career, are excited by doing new things. While money is a motivator, most developers are less entrepreneurial and more focused on building interesting software. FAANG companies have a culture around progress and growth, whereas the financial services industry is about stability/predictability. FAANG company culture can be more dynamic and entertaining than working with “boring old banks”. There is also a lot of hype around FAANG that projects an image developers desire. In other words, FAANG markets themselves in a way developers like. Once you work with either of these kinds of companies, your perspective may change. As a consultant, I’ve had a wide array of experience in this space. Whenever I work with Amazon, it is always an extreme…. it’s either a wonderful experience or miserable. They have, hands-down, one of the worst cultures I’ve worked in. They also have one of the top 10 best. These companies are large enough to have multiple cultures. The employees are always motivated to do things very well though, even in the stressful work environments. The financial services industry is very different. I’ve been lucky enough to work with several clients building new financial products, and they often have the same enthusiasm for development (and compensation). However; more of the experiences are pretty humdrum. There’s a job. You do it. There’s no fanfare around it and people continue about their day… because that’s how the business operates. Many of the employees I see at these companies have been there for 20+yrs, because they’re tired and want stability. I see more of that as developers get older and have more life responsibilities. In my experience, the financial service clients have always had a better work-life balance. The FAANG companies are the ones I use in my sales pitches though. When an employee moves on, they use their experience as a personal sales pitch in their interviews. There is another similar reason some developers want to be a part of FAANG. Some developers want to start their own business. FAANG companies have a huge marketing engine that promotes individual developers, and some even have VC that backs former employees. Ever notice how the people on Twitter or Quora who worked at these companies typically have higher follower counts? It’s easier to gain an audience when a FAANG company retweets you to their mega-audience. That’s called piggybacking to build an audience. It was an early entrepreneurial success strategy. These days, I find that to be a tired approach, but it still resonates with a lot of developers. The point in all this is that FAANG employment resonates with the lifestyle and goals many people have. Banks do too, but people who pursue those lifestyles tend to be more reserved/quiet compared to those seeking FAANG lifestyles. That’s why you hear so little about these roles.\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Assistant: While it can be tempting to pursue high-profile companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google (FAANG), or other well-known tech companies, there are several reasons why some developers may choose these positions over more traditional roles. Here are a few potential motivations for this choice:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. High Pay: Many high-profile companies pay significantly higher salaries than their competitors. This can make up for any potential drawbacks related to work-life balance or industry familiarity.\n",
      "2. Recognition and Prestige: The reputation associated with working at a FAANG company can be highly desirable, especially among individuals who value recognition and prestige.\n",
      "3. Global Reach: With offices in multiple countries around the world, the FAANG companies offer employees exposure to different cultures and international business environments. This can be appealing for those seeking a diverse work environment.\n",
      "4. Opportunities for Leadership: As these companies grow, they often look to promote from within rather than externally, giving employees with relevant experience opportunities for leadership roles within the company.\n",
      "5. Work-Life Balance: In contrast to some of the more traditional industries, the work-life balance offered by FAANG companies is generally considered excellent. This can include flexible schedules, remote work options, and ample vacation time.\n",
      "6. Professional Development Opportunities: These companies invest heavily in employee development programs and offer frequent training and workshops. This provides opportunities for professional growth and advancement.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's important to note that while these factors can influence an individual's decision to join a FAANG company, they should also consider the specific needs of their own career goals and personal preferences. Some individuals may prefer more stable employment, greater industry familiarity, or other aspects of a less popular but more traditional role. Ultimately, the best decision for each person will depend on their unique circumstances and priorities.\n",

The Continue ReadingAt Yahoo, what you do as a product manager varies depending on the following: What type of product you're working on. Is it customer-facing or a corporate internal tool? Is it desktop or mobile web or native app? The company has different excitement levels for different products. This will reflect on the level of support you'll be getting from stakeholders.What phase of the product you're in. Is it a product you're building from scratch or an already existing one. The experience is fundamentally different.The team you're working with. Yahoo has outstanding teams as well as mediocre ones. The best teams are working on the most strategic products.I will share my experience here (with removing any proprietary information). Currently I am a product manager on an iOS/Android app. So here's how my days look like: Research what's out there in the market. Keep an eye on the competitors; what they are doing and what they are expected to do. I do that through quick competitive analysis studies that I perform on regular basis. I use a simple competitor array to make sure i do that quickly. Check the template on Wikipedia under Competitor analysis. Conduct persona creation sessions to forge our target audience and their behaviors I invite a lot of people from different departments to participate in those sessions. It always helps to get fresh ideas from non-technical people. Create user stories based on the persona created. Prioritize user stories according to what makes sense for the user. Iteration is in the core of what we do. The small agile team is always involved in the very details of the product. Sometimes we iterate on an icon design 10 times or more. This process is very informal and very rapid. I work very closely with engineers, designers and testers. We literally sit in the very same area with no borders or walls.I do NOT have solid set requirements when development starts.I realized it's a bad idea if you want to go agile. When we start development our requirements is a collection of user stories, story boards, paper prototypes and whiteboards, where the details can change at any moment. This is actually inexpensive and works very well when you have a small team (3-5 people) setting closely together. This doesn't mean changing the overall scope often. Only the details change. Requirements evolve during development. Every morning, and during the daily SCRUM (which doesn't take more than 20 minutes), we discuss what we did yesterday, what we'll do today and if there any impediments. My job is to remove those impediments. Then I start drawing user flaws in a huge white board that's physically next to our cube. Anybody in the agile team is encouraged to give their opinion about the user flow and the details of UX. This takes usually 15 to 30 minutes. Then we start implementing. This feedback process doesn't stop, we discuss every single detail as it's being built. This can be distracting, but the benefits over-weighs the drawbacks.It's not only the SCRUM team who needs to be involved here. I continuously communicate with other stakeholders like sales, marketing, biz dev, PR, legal and senior management, and make sure I collect their requirements.To make sure that all stakeholders are aware of what's going on, I conduct weekly/monthly product demos where i showcase the current progress and what will be accomplished next week. It's extremely important for stakeholders to be aware of what you're doing. This is how you get their buy-in. Which is crucial when you're building a new product. During development and on daily-basis, I write requirements for the team, make sure they have all the artifacts they need. Sometimes write pieces of code that will accelerate their work. An example of that will be that a developer needs a list of images IDs that are stored in an excel file. You need to strip those IDs and covert then to CSV file for him. You need to do a lot of house-cleaning so your SCRUM team doesn't stop. Anything that keeps the flow going. And if you find yourself free (which rarely happen), I do some bug fixing. Not freaking out: I am adding this as a daily activity simply because it's an essential part of what you do: You'll be bombarded with ideas and suggestions from people in the org and from users, trying to give you 'awesome' ideas on how to make the product better or how to quickly monetize it. Your role is calm down, absorb these suggestions, think them through and filter only the meaningful ones. While keeping everybody happy.Make sure that the team is focused on the high-level scope. I do that through stressing that every single day, minimizing the number of meetings as much as possible, and block external noise. This is paramount to be able to deliver on time.Check out the code on your machine and test like crazy. Test, test and test.Keep a relentless attention to details. The more details you know, and the more technical you're involved in the product, the better. Unfortunately, as a product manager, there's no threshold to how deep you go in the details on all levels: code, UX, SEO, QE ...etc. Developers will always welcome you being involved in what they do, but by doing that, make sure you know your technical limits too and respect their aptitude. Live and breath the product. Use the product all the time. Always keep a note next to you when you discover bugs or an idea for a feature pops. I use Evernote wherever i go. Motivating the team: keep your team motivated through explaining to them why we're doing what we're doing. Get them excited for the product. This is how you get the best out of them. Do users interviews on monthly basis. You will be surprised how users will use your product. After proving that the product you created is being used, establish a growth trajectory for the product. This involves many activities: working with marketing, business development and PR. Define what type of growth activity is will get you the maximum ROI: sticky, viral or paid. Focusing on metrics that really matter. For a mobile app for example, this can be active users/day, minutes spent/active users and weekly retention rate. Everything else does not really matter. Continuously learning stuff: I went to electrical engineering school, so you guessed it right: I have a lot of catch up to do. I use: http://www.udacity.com/ and https://www.coursera.org/.Do your team's laundry if necessary :)\n",

Look, it is not that you must be from a CS/IT background. Deloitte is a company that looks for people who are able to learn quickly. For getting selected into Deloitte, either show very good portfolio of technical knowledge directly coming from IT industry or else show a good portfolio of extra curricular activities by presenting yourself in a very decent manner. Let me tell you the selection process: 1. Written In written test, you have 5sections (English, Maths, Reasoning, SQL, C-coding). For clearing the test, you just require basic mathematics up to 10th standard. Reasoning questions are mostly from arrangements in different manners and sequences. For SQL, I would suggest going through the extreme cases (NULL statements), transactions, etc. Refer Ivan Bayross if you want to learn SQL. C coding involves two questions: 20marks and 40marks respectively. One question is for creating a pattern and another examines the arrays and pointers logics. 2. Group Case Study The case studies are usually from the situations where data maintenance is a problem and for it you should just keep points in a well planned manner and with references to upcoming technologies in market. Believe me, don’t take names of extreme technologies that are not required for the situation. Some people just know a word Hadoop and they start saying this everywhere even where handling of big data is not required. Analyze the case properly and then build your points. It is usually of 7–10 minutes and in this 7mins are for discussion and 3mins for giving presentation on sheets that will be provided to you. I got this case study, ” There is a company running 3 atomic energy plants but their reporting tool takes a long time. Apart from this, the data is not centralized.

Linking to code on GitHub or Research Papers is also a good thing.Software engineering skills. Back in the days, researchers and professors did not code as much because they had students to do it for them. Its important that your candidate understands coding and can demonstrate it through previous projects or a coding exercise.Machine learning and NLP classes. If you are looking at a fresh grad, make sure that they have taken one or more of the following classes: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Text Mining and Information Retrieval and Data Mining.A Degree preferably in a computational field. I think this is important although can be replaced with significant work experience in the field. You need to have fairly solid math, algorithms and critical thinking skills to be able successfully analyze all that unstructured data and build models for real business problems. That usually comes with bachelors level education and higher.Watch Out for (red flag! red flag!):Deep Learning Experts without any of the above qualities.0 relevant projects to point to0 experience with text, but lots with images. There needs to be a shift in thinking for an image person to start making progress with text. There is a learning curve, and I personally believe its steep. It took me years to get to a place where text mining and NLP are just second nature to me. Now, if you ask me to start working with images, its going to take me a while!Word count projects - while counting words is a very basic form of text mining, it should not be weighed heavily as NLP experience.\n",

      "Question: What are the best and efficient ways to learn algorithms for beginners?\n",
      "True Answer: To answer your question in the most effective way possible, I would say that there isn’t any easy way to learn algorithms. However there are efficient methods in which you can learn them and if you can put in that effort, it will slowly start feeling easy for you. So to come to your question- the efficient ways to learn DSA mainly depend on these factors mentioned below:The prior knowledge you have about the topics of DSAThe ultimate goal which you want to achieve by learning DSAResources that are available and which you can useGuides for helping you throughout the wayNow let's look into what IContinue ReadingTo answer your question in the most effective way possible, I would say that there isn’t any easy way to learn algorithms. However there are efficient methods in which you can learn them and if you can put in that effort, it will slowly start feeling easy for you. So to come to your question- the efficient ways to learn DSA mainly depend on these factors mentioned below:The prior knowledge you have about the topics of DSAThe ultimate goal which you want to achieve by learning DSAResources that are available and which you can useGuides for helping you throughout the wayNow let's look into what I meant by each of these points:Prior knowledge of DSA:Do you already know the basics of DSA? Are you well versed with basic data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, etc and can you implement Searching and Sorting algorithms? If your answers to these questions are yes, then yes you can easily learn the subject in detail and you won’t be taking much time as a newbie would need. Now if your answer is no then you have a long way to go to grasp the basics first and then dive into more complicated details. 2. Goal to achieve by learning DS and Algorithms: Now to figure out how deep you must delve into the subject you first need to have your goals clear. Some people learn DSA for acing programming interviews, some for winning competitive coding competitions and few do it just to increase their knowledge in this area.If you are learning DSA for cracking job exams or interviews, you need to learn a few selected sets of data structures that are generally asked in interviews and focus on them for scoring well.If you are preparing for competitive coding, then you will have to build your knowledge in complex data structures which includes Binary Indexed trees, segment trees, and Fenwick trees.Now if you are just learning to enhance your knowledge there is no dearth of things to learn on this topic, so you can start with the basics and go into the complex ones.3. Resources available: There are multiple books which are present on this subject which you can refer to. Let me tell you some books which I followed while I prepared for DSA:Algorithms Unlocked- Thomas CoremanAlgorithmic puzzles- Anany and Maria LevitinMathematics for Computer Science- by MIT open courseware4. Guidance: Now you have an idea about how you can learn DSA and why you are learning it. Also, you have an idea about the books you can refer to for learning the subject. Now you need to figure out a guide - an institute, an online course, or mentors to help you learn the topics well or progress in your career. There are many options out there- multiple online courses or online institutes you can learn DSA from. But I would suggest you check out such an institute which would not only teach you the topics well but would also give you sufficient career guidance if you need so at the moment. After checking out many institutes I found such an institute that would help you in the whole process- from teaching the topics, to helping you prepare for interviews and build your resume. The institute’s name is Tutort Academy. They offer 1:1 doubt clearing sessions, live interactive sessions, mock interviews, and resume building sessions which would help you out especially if you are a working professional looking for a change in your career. Especially if you are targetting to land a job in a top-tier MNC, this institute would help you achieve that goal.\n",
