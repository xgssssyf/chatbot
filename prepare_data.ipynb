If you want to skip the rant and go to my actual advice, scroll to the bottom! Rant Yes, it’s an obvious advantage that you know some programming. Coding proficiency is a basic requirement to do machine learning, although it’s not as important as in a typical software developer job. Mathematical optimization and calculus is somewhat important. Linear algebra and statistics is really important. Probability and combinatorics is really important. But these are just prerequisites. Most importantly, machine learning is an entire branch of computer science in itself. There is feature engineering, deep learning, ensembling and all kinds of stuff you need to learn about that are not part of the above-mentioned areas. If you come from a regular programming background, machine learning will require a shift in perspective. You’re no longer dealing with deterministic logic in the form of ifs and elses. You’re now dealing with probabilities and uncertainties. In most of software development, the business logic is very simple. In machine learning, business logic is everything. Object-oriented programming is no longer important. Efficient functions are. For loops and while loops are things to be avoided. Matrix multiplications and vectorized code is your new bread and butter. I’m tempted to say that you will need to throw out everything you have learned about programming and start over. That would be an exagerration, but there is some truth in it. Advice With your background, you have a really good foundation for becoming a big data architect. Linux, Python, Java and systems administration is mostly what big data is all about. As a big data developer, you can start experimenting with big data anlytics and gradually progress into machine learning from there.\n",

You can still focus on machine learning, moving forward.Being a Java developer, you know that more than Java per se, you have knowledge of the programming concepts.Classes, objects, project structure, Gui apps etc.Constructs like reading files, parsing huge amount of data, cleansing it, using algorithms etc.These concepts are language agnostic. Language is a tool to implement this.Machine learning is the art of deriving meaning out of data, gaining insights such that we can extrapolate and predict behavior.Here are the high level steps to venture into Machine learning:Agnostic of languages, the concepts of machine learning involve knowing the concepts ofTest dataTraining dataFeature engineeringBinary vs. proficient attributesGaussian distributionsNormalization and a ton of algorithms etc.Understand the theory behind these. Familiarize yourself with the concepts.Once you know the concepts, you need to focus on the tools to exercise your skills.At this point Python and R will be two languages that you will always hear about. So you need to get started on those languages.And they are phenomenal languages for machine learning and data science.They are like power tools to deal with machine learning.Do machine learning problems freely available out there.The internet has a ton of machine learning problems.Exercise and solve them, starting with the simplest of ones and progressing slowly. Use as much help as possible.Take part in machine learning contests and challengesThere are very motivating websites like http://krackle.com etc, that help you motivate in solving machine learning problems. Go for it, and get more and more confident in solving real world problems.Those high level steps should get you started and running. As for not letting go of Java: The thing to remember is that every organization that deals with machine learning projects or systems, has a vast eco-system of surrounding applications. E.g.An e-commerce or insurance company data stream may need utility programs to import data from external sources into your eco-systemFrom here on, machine learning languages can do their things.Again for building dashboards etc. to demonstrate the output of machine learning, orgs may need APIs and websites.ML code will dump insights into a store. And then on top of the store, you could have APIs and web sites to surface them in a friendly manner.For the before and after part of ML systems, you can totally leverage Java.I guess the takeaway is that even though Python and R are the ML languages, a typical organization or company will always need additional expertise possessed by data science employees for these surrounding applications. Bonus. And you maybe in a very good position, where you are good at data science as well as these peripheral applications. So it maybe worth doing Java on the side and not lose touch totally.\n",

These were the 7 most common things I saw when I interviewed at big companies (Facebook, Intel, Square, eBay, etc) for data science related positions. Basic Programming Languages: You should know a statistical programming language, like R or Python (along with Numpy and Pandas Libraries), and a database querying language like SQL Statistics: You should be able to explain phrases like null hypothesis, P-value, maximum likelihood estimators and confidence intervals. Statistics is important to crunch data and to pick out the most important figures out of a huge dataset. This is critical in the decision-making process and to design experiments. Machine Learning: You should be able to explain K-nearest neighbors, random forests, and ensemble methods. These techniques typically are implemented in R or Python. These algorithms show to employers that you have exposure to how data science can be used in more practical manners. Data Wrangling: You should be able to clean up data. This basically means understanding that \"California\" and \"CA\" are the same thing - a negative number cannot exist in a dataset that describes population. It is all about identifying corrupt (or impure) data and and correcting/deleting them. Data Visualization: Data scientist is useless on his or her own. They need to communicate their findings to Product Managers in order to make sure those data are manifesting into real applications. Thus, familiarity with data visualization tools like ggplot is very important (so you can SHOW data, not just talk about them) Software Engineering: You should know algorithms and data structures, as they are often necessary in creating efficient algorithms for machine learning. Know the use cases and run time of these data structures: Queues, Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Trees, etc. Product Management: This one is definitely debatable, but those who understand the product are the ones who will know what metrics are the most important. There are tons of numbers one can A/B test, so product-oriented data scientist will pick the right metrics to experiment with. Know what these terms mean: Usability Testing, Wireframing, Retention and Conversion Rates, Traffic Analysis, Customer Feedback, Internal Logs, A/B Testing. In each field, I mentioned few buzzwords you should know about. There are tons of websites you could use, so I recommend using these 7 branches as a roadmap to guide yourself.

Cross-posting here from How to Ace a Data Science Interview. As I mentioned in my first post, I have just finished an extensive tech job search, which featured eight on-sites, along with countless phone screens and informal chats. I was interviewing for a combination of data science and software engineering (machine learning) positions, and I got a pretty good sense of what those interviews are like. In this post, I give an overview of what you should expect in a data science interview, and some suggestions for how to prepare. An interview is not a pop quiz. You should know what to expect going in, and you can take the time to prepare for it. During the interview phase of the process, your recruiter is on your side and can usually tell you what types of interviews you’ll have. Even if the recruiter is reluctant to share that, common practices in the industry are a good guide to what you’re likely to see. In this post, I’ll go over the types of data science interviews I’ve encountered, and offer my advice on how to prepare for them. Data science roles generally fall into two broad ares of focus: statistics and machine learning. I only applied to the latter category, so that’s the type of position discussed in this post. My experience is also limited to tech companies, so I can’t offer guidance for data science in finance, biotech, etc.. Here are the types of interviews (or parts of interviews) I’ve come across. Always:Coding (usually whiteboard)Applied machine learningYour backgroundOften:Culture fitMachine learning theoryDataset analysisStatsYou will encounter a similar set of interviews for a machine learning software engineering position, though more of the questions will fall in the coding category. Coding (usually whiteboard)This is the same type of interview you’d have for any software engineering position, though the expectations may be less stringent. There are lots of websites and books that will tell you how to prepare. Practice your coding skills if they’re rusty. Don’t forget to practice coding away from the computer (e.g. on paper), which is surely a skill that’s rusty. Review the data structures you may never have used outside of school — binary search trees, linked lists, heaps. Be comfortable with recursion. Know how to reason about algorithm running times. You can generally use any “real” language you want in an interview (Matlab doesn’t count, unfortunately); Python’s succinct syntax makes it a great language for coding interviews. Prep tips:If you get nervous in interviews, try doing some practice problems under time pressure.If you don’t have much software engineering experience, see if you can get a friend to look over your practice code and provide feedback.During the interview:Make sure you understand exactly what problem you’re trying to solve. Ask the interviewer questions if anything is unclear or underspecified.Make sure you explain your plan to the interviewer before you start writing any code, so that they can help you avoid spending time going down less-than-ideal paths.If you can’t think of a good way to do something, it often helps to start by talking through a dumb way to do it.Mention what invalid inputs you’d want to check for (e.g. input variable type check). Don’t bother writing the code to do so unless the interviewer asks. In all my interviews, nobody has ever asked.Before declaring that your code is finished, think about variable initialization, end conditions, and boundary cases (e.g. empty inputs). If it seems helpful, run through an example. You’ll score points by catching your bugs yourself, rather than having the interviewer point them out.Applied machine learningAll the applied machine learning interviews I’ve had focused on supervised learning. The interviewer will present you with a prediction problem, and ask you to explain how you would set up an algorithm to make that prediction. The problem selected is often relevant to the company you’re interviewing at (e.g. figuring out which product to recommend to a user, which users are going to stop using the site, which ad to display, etc.), but can also be a toy example (e.g. recommending board games to a friend). This type of interview doesn’t depend on much background knowledge, other than having a general understanding of machine learning concepts (see below). However, it definitely helps to prepare by brainstorming the types of problems a particular company might ask you to solve. Even if you miss the mark, the brainstorming session will help with the culture fit interview (also see below). When answering this type of question, I’ve found it helpful to start by laying out the setup of the problem. What are the inputs? What are the labels you’re trying to predict? What machine learning algorithms could you run on the data? Sometimes the setup will be obvious from the question, but sometimes you’ll need to figure out how to define the problem. In the latter case, you’ll generally have a discussion with the interviewer about some plausible definitions (e.g., what does it mean for a user to “stop using the site”?). The main component of your answer will be feature engineering. There is nothing magical about brainstorming features. Think about what might be predictive of the variable you are trying to predict, and what information you would actually have available. I’ve found it helpful to give context around what I’m trying to capture, and to what extent the features I’m proposing reflect that information. For the sake of concreteness, here’s an example. Suppose Amazon is trying to figure out what books to recommend to you. (Note: I did not interview at Amazon, and have no idea what they actually ask in their interviews.) To predict what books you’re likely to buy, Amazon can look for books that are similar to your past Amazon purchases. But maybe some purchases were mistakes, and you vowed to never buy a book like that again. Well, Amazon knows how you’ve interacted with your Kindle books. If there’s a book you started but never finished, it might be a positive signal for general areas you’re interested in, but a negative signal for the particular author. Or maybe some categories of books deserve different treatment. For example, if a year ago you were buying books targeted at one-year-olds, Amazon could deduce that nowadays you’re looking for books for two-year-olds. It’s easy to see how you can spend a while exploring the space between what you’d like to know and what you can actually find out. Your backgroundYou should be prepared to give a high-level summary of your career, as well as to do a deep-dive into a project you’ve worked on. The project doesn’t have to be directly related to the position you’re interviewing for (though it can’t hurt), but it needs to be the kind of work you can have an in-depth technical discussion about. To prepare:Review any papers/presentations that came out of your projects to refresh your mind on the technical details.Practice explaining your project to a friend in order to make sure you are telling a coherent story. Keep in mind that you’ll probably be talking to someone who’s smart but doesn’t have expertise in your particular field.Be prepared to answer questions as to why you chose the approach that you did, and about your individual contribution to the project.Culture fitHere are some culture fit questions your interviewers are likely to be interested in. These questions might come up as part of other interviews, and will likely be asked indirectly. It helps to keep what the interviewer is looking for in the back of your mind.Are you specifically interested in the product/company/space you’d be working in?It helps to prepare by thinking about the problems the company is trying to solve, and how you and the team you’d be part of could make a difference.Do you care about impact? Even in a research-oriented corporate environment, I wouldn’t recommend saying that you don’t care about company metrics, and that you’d love to just play with data and write papers.Will you work well with other people? I know it’s a cliché, but most work is collaborative, and companies are trying to assess this as best they can. Avoid bad-mouthing former colleagues, and show appreciation for their contributions to your projects.Are you willing to get your hands dirty? If there’s annoying work that needs to be done (e.g. cleaning up messy data), will you take care of it?Are you someone the team will be happy to have around on a personal level? Even though you might be stressed, try to be friendly, positive, enthusiastic and genuine throughout the interview process.You may also get broad questions about what kinds of work you enjoy and what motivates you. It’s useful to have an answer ready, but there may not be a “right” answer the interviewer is looking for. Machine learning theoryThis type of interview will test your understanding of basic machine learning concepts, generally with a focus on supervised learning. You should understand:The general setup for a supervised learning systemWhy you want to split data into training and test setsThe idea that models that aren’t powerful enough can’t capture the right generalizations about the data, and ways to address this (e.g. different model or projection into a higher-dimensional space)The idea that models that are too powerful suffer from overfitting, and ways to address this (e.g. regularization)You don’t need to know a lot of machine learning algorithms, but you definitely need to understand logistic regression, which seems to be what most companies are using. I also had some in-depth discussions of SVMs, but that may just be because I brought them up. Dataset analysisIn this type of interview, you will be given a data set, and asked to write a script to pull out features for some prediction task. You may be asked to then plug the features into a machine learning algorithm. This interview essentially adds an implementation component to the applied machine learning interview (see above). Of course, your features may now be inspired by what you see in the data. Do the distributions for each feature you’re considering differ between the labels you’re trying to predict? I found these interviews hardest to prepare for, because the recruiter often wouldn’t tell me what format the data would be in, and what exactly I’d need to do with it. (For example, do I need to review Python’s csv import module? Should I look over the syntax for training a model in scikit-learn?) I also had one recruiter tell me I’d be analyzing “big data”, which was a bit intimidating (am I going to be working with distributed databases or something?) until I discovered at the interview that the “big data” set had all of 11,000 examples. I encourage you to push for as much info as possible about what you’ll actually be doing. If you plan to use Python, working through the scikit-learn tutorial is a good way to prepare. StatsI have a decent intuitive understanding of statistics, but very little formal knowledge. Most of the time, this sufficed, though I’m sure knowing more wouldn’t have hurt. You should understand how to set up an A/B test, including random sampling, confounding variables, summary statistics (e.g. mean), and measuring statistical significance. Preparation Checklist & ResourcesHere is a summary list of tips for preparing for data science interviews, along with a few helpful resources.Coding (usually whiteboard)Get comfortable with basic algorithms, data structures and figuring out algorithm complexity.Practice writing code away from the computer in your programming language of choice.Resources:Pretty exhaustive list of what you might encounter in an interviewMany interview prep books, e.g. Cracking the Coding InterviewApplied machine learningThink about the machine learning problems that are relevant for each company you’re interviewing at. Use these problems as practice questions.Your backgroundThink through how to summarize your experience.Prepare to give an in-depth technical explanation of a project you’ve worked on.

      "A: The key to crack any interview is the following not only in data science: Patience, Practice, Positive nature (PPP) - Have Patience when things are not going in your way.

Right from fresContinue ReadingThe key to crack any interview is the following not only in data science: Patience, Practice, Positive nature (PPP) - Have Patience when things are not going in your way. Convert your worries to actions- Improve your coding skills with practice. You should be positive about your future. No matter what. You will get what you want. First Have the patience to read my long post :-) It is only my way of looking at things. Please ignore if something hurts you. Many of us look for easy ways(short cuts/tips) to crack any type of interviews like going through previous Interview questions etc... Right from fresher to Project Manager level are looking for these jobs. The answer to this question is different for different people. Ask yourself the following questions: Are you a fresher, or experienced, If experienced(other than data science), how many years: less than 5, 5-10, or more than 10. Here I consider (0-3 years) as Fresher Bin1: because they are in the early stage of Career. (3 -10) years as Bin2. Above 10 years as another Bin3. Fresher(Bin1) : We know what to do but we look for others to guide us. Just I am reminding you what you have forgotten. Before appearing for an interview You should be good at following things. 1. Machine learning fundamentals. 2. Python programming 3. Good presentation skills You already know this Right. How to get these. First and foremost thing: Are you trying on your own or under some guidance like taking the course offline or online? Because you should have solid Machine learning concepts or material with you. If you do not have this, prepare your material first. Of course, you should be good at coding as well. Assuming you know data preprocessing. How to prepare your material 1. List down the Machine learning Algorithms you are familiar with. 2. Browse the blogs, books, videos, get the intuition of each algorithm how it works. Write a few lines( not more than 50 words) about the algorithm in simple terms I repeat layman terms. Look into the Maths part when it is needed only. 3. Get hold of the Algorithm even with numerical examples wherever it is possible For example in K-nearest neighbor Given data points(instances) with target how to do you decide the target of the test data point. Here we do simple distance calculation and we take mode based on k value. Likewise for other algorithms how to choose root node(decision trees), Clustering (Computing Centroid and forming clusters), Naive Bayes(Bayers theorem), and so on wherever it is possible. 4. Prepare sample code snippets for each algorithm in python. 5. Explain to your friends in very simple terms, so that they can understand. Likewise, all the major concepts like bias-variance, overfitting-underfitting, cross-validation, splitting data into train data, and test data, whichever concept you read to give your best. Do not forget the statistics. Now comes to Interview, Give simple terms. Explain the concept in simple terms and say the concept name. ( Strictly no shortcut answers) What is overfitting: People talk about bias-variance trade-off though they are not clear about that. Is there any other way to answer this. Think in terms of the error in train data and test data. (If you are clear with this and confident that you can convince the interviewer you can opt this, but do not get into unnecessary trouble by speaking terms which you don't know) Know what you speak. No shortcut answers Eg; What is Principal Component Analysis? Many of us give a one-line answer It is a dimensionality reduction technique. which is not recommended. What if you explain in the following way. Start with data: In some domains, there is a problem either classification or regression. Now when there are more attributes/dimensions/columns in the data, If we want to see a quick look at the results. I opt for a less no. of dimensions as much as possible. I can find it by finding orthogonal components where each component is a linear combination of the other components. These are called eigenvectors which we find through eigenvalues from Covariance Matrix by solving equation (A-lamda) * x=0. I select only the top few components which explain more variance in the data through the scree plot. (Though we are not going into mathematics you should have this in your mind). If at all interviewer asks the next question to solve the equation you should be ready to do it. The Disadvantage of this is we can't explain it to the business as each component is a linear combination. The advantage is sometimes linear combination will make sense; Eg: predict the score of a dish where attributes are ingredients. Now component becomes a linear combination of ingredients and etc.. You should answer every question with confidence. This comes through practice. In parallel to the above, you should have basic python programming skills as well. Solve python exercises from different websites, need not be from data science. Type python programming exercises in Google take top10 websites. Get your hands dirty in Pandas, NumPy, various operations on data, preprocessing data, Take several datasets to build multiple algorithms without copying code from the Internet. Improve debugging skills. Change the approach to Learning by debugging from Learning by Coding once you are comfortable with coding. If you do everything as specified, It will boost your confidence. This helps you to crack the interview. Further, have some idea on what is going on in data science; Get some basic concepts in Text mining and deep learning if you are a beginner. You can apply the same method even in these areas as well. Bin2: By doing above all how do you use your current job experience. Get the domain knowledge; Try to link data science problems to your domain, From a fresher, we can expect technical. But from experienced think like if you want to take a person into your project What you expect from him. As you are experienced start exploring git, version control tools, how can you use your previous experience into DataScience? It is just like you are moving to new technology. Use your commonsense and experience, Show your experience in thoughts and talks. You are not a kid anymore. Bin3: Not much to say; They should think, In What way we can add value to the existing system through data science. Stop depending on the others, You are an experienced person as a Manager, Team Lead, Module Lead, Tech Manager etc.. You know how the system works. No need to reinvent the wheel. Convert the industry problems to data science problems and get into the research. Saying is easy I know. But It is reality. You should accept it and move on. How can you help the company with your thoughts and work? You are the guide to yourself and your team. Update 2nd September: Go through the very basics of SQL. Having some knowledge in SQL is a plus. What is SQL?SQL Retrieve data from tables [33 Exercises]SQL Aggregate Functions [25 Exercises]SQL JOINSSQL JOINS [29 Exercises]As I said earlier every one knew this just I am reminding you.

The ridiculousness of that time in hiring was palpable. People salivating over resumes that could spell HTML and people getting hired if they had a hint of an ability to use a text editor and make a web page appear in a browser. Everyone with a semi-functioning brain was buying “Learn HTML in 24 Hours” and having recruiters fall over themselves to offer amazing salaries for no demonstration of ability other than claim buzzwords on a resume. Those of us who had been writing code for years, before and after the Web became mainstream, looked on in amusement. The rare times I encountered these buzzword wonders they got educated and found out there are actual skills involved in this. To people like me the Web was just another platform to target, a cruder, text-based version of the client-server applications I’d been writing for years. When things went south in 2000–2001 all I saw was a correction in the market that I had been expecting. Those of us who could actually code and had skills remained employed and a lot of consultants and wannabes that faked it well right up until they had to prove themselves got separated from the market. Basically back to life as it was before the Dot Com boom but with a different platform and better pay. The era of realizing that software development was actually hard began here and companies had to decide who to keep. Those who could code well were kept. I survived several rounds of layoffs in that period. I didn’t lack confidence in my skills and I have always been able to “walk the walk” when it comes to development and technology. 2008–2009 was a financial crisis. If you worked in or around the financial industry you were affected. Any contraction outside that industry was done as opportunism or as a result of ripple effects into companies who worked with the financial industry. I work in finance. Very conservative, stable finance. I didn’t fear for my job then because I knew I’d be one of the last out of the building if it came to that. It never did and really never had a possibility to do so. My company is very well run to prevent that type of thing from happening. Saw the panic for the emotional reaction it was and just kept on working. I made out decently afterwards because I doubled my 401(k) contributions when my stupid colleagues were stopping theirs out of panic. I had a very nice rate of return going into 2010 for seeing that market dip as a temporary thing (as almost all are). I have never worried for my ability to keep my job. I have found over the two plus decades I’ve been doing this that those who truly have the skills to solve problems and can communicate well will never lack for employment. Those who are concerned about their jobs in lean times who aren’t contractors need to do some deep, honest soul searching on their true abilities and figure out how much of their employment is due to complacency versus true ability.\n",

Preparing for system design interview questions in ten days may look like an impossible thing. However, with the right materials you can even do it with a lesser amount of time. All you would need then is an unbreakable focus and consistency to smooth out your skills before your big day. While preparing for system design interview, there are some specific skills that you ought to have ready in your sleeves. You don’t have to think hard on what these skills might be since there are lots of online courses out there that have put together hundreds of these questions and their solutions as they are applied to the real word. Which is what your interviewer would be looking at for while accessing you? Personally, I have found some of these courses a little helpful and it would help you out if you try them to get up to speed while preparing for your interview. Here are five places online I think might be helpful to you. 1. Grokking the System Design Interview ( Educative: Interactive Courses for Software Developers ) This is one of the first courses that describe the scale distributed system design problems in detail. Even if you are not too good in system design, there are a lot of things that you can learn from this course which you would find very helpful. Authors have created this course to provide you design choices (including pros and cons) so that you can understand the requirement, compare approaches, and come up with the best solution for the problem at hand. This course has helped 60k+ subscribers to crack their system design interview (SDI). System design questions have become a standard part of the software engineering interview process. Performance in these interviews reflects upon your ability to work with complex systems and translates into the position and salary the interviewing company offers you. Unfortunately, most engineers struggle with SDI, partly because of their lack of experience in developing large-scale systems and partly because of the unstructured nature of SDIs. Even engineers who've some experience building such systems aren't comfortable with these interviews, mainly due to the open-ended nature of design problems that don't have a standard answer. This course is a complete guide to master SDIs. It is created by hiring managers who've been working at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. We've carefully chosen a set of questions that have been repeatedly asked at top companies. 2. Full stack data structures and software system design online course (Learnbay.io | Master Data structure, Algorithms & System Design) When dealing with job hunting, the best place to look is where your employers is heading towards. This course at learnBay would take you a leap into the next big thing in the labor market as far as system design is involve. The full stack course data structure and software system design course provides companies, nonprofits, and governments the supremacy to create internal expertise and convince employees’ appetite for learning plus development. Therefore, taking part of this initiative as an individual would be a great step in your career and a great way to impress your interviewer. By showing them that you know what the next big thing in the market is and you are willing to take part in it. This course is split into three section - HLD – High level design. LLD – Low level design and Impotent Design Patterns. 3. Software Design and Architecture Specialization ( coursera ) Software Architecture and Design teaches the principles and concepts involved in the analysis and design of large software systems. This course is split into four sections: (1) Introduction, (2) UML and Analysis, (3) Software Architecture, and (4) Software Design. In the Software Design and Architecture Specialization, you will learn how to apply design principles, patterns, and architectures to create reusable and flexible software applications and systems. You will learn how to express and document the design and architecture of a software system using a visual notation. Practical examples and opportunities to apply your knowledge will help you develop employable skills and relevant expertise in the software industry. The specialization also includes a project, and you will be awarded a certificate after completing the course. The best part of this specialization is that you will learn the science behind Software design and architecture. Once you know the relevant patterns and principles, it would be much easier to communicate your plan with your fellow programmers and stakeholders. You will also gain the ability to critically view a software or piece of code from the design perspective. 4. Data structures and software design ( edX ) This is another great course to learn System design and Software design. This course is part of the CS Essentials for Software Development Professional Certificate program. This course will take your skills to the next level by teaching you how to write “good” software that appropriately represents and organizes data, is easy to maintain, and is of high quality. You will not only learn how to convert a set of requirements into a high-quality software design but also how to write efficient code that is easy to read, understand, and modify. This is a great free course to learn two essential skills data structure and software design. The class is 4-weeks long and requires 8–10 hours of effort weekly. The course also offers a certificate, but you need to pay for it. 5. Software architecture and design. ( Udacity ) Software Architecture and Design teaches the principles and concepts involved in the analysis and design of large software systems. This course is split into four sections: (1) Introduction, (2) UML and Analysis, (3) Software Architecture, and (4) Software Design. The interesting part about this course is that if you are a beginner here is a good place to brush up your skills. The explanation given here is much grounded and it could be master in the shortest possible time by anyone with a healthy mind. However, it is exciting to know that the content of this course is completely free and it is accessible to anyone, including its downloadable training materials. Udacity has made everything completely free on this one. Why take a course. Impressing an employer is not going to be easy, not to mention when you have a short amount of time in your hands to prepare yourself for the interview. However, the reason why you should focus on some of these draft out materials is so many one couldn’t exhaust them here. It might interest you to know that majority of the work you might be doing in your new job would be some of the simple design things. Which means your interviewer would be looking out if you actually have a solid background when it comes to system design. Also there are two things you should know while preparing for an interview, one they are trying to understand if you have knowledge about your responsibilities. This means that you don’t have to play super man at this moment, just a workable knowledge is enough for now. Secondly, you don’t have to waste your time trying to solve the big problems to get the role. That is why all these courses I have mention, I think would be of value. Most of them have helped thousands of individuals secure jobs, so if you are relying on them, then you are not completely out of line. Quick Tips:Try to follow 80-20 rule during your interview, where 80% of the time you will be speaking and explaining everything and 20% of the time your interviewer.Don’t use buzzwords and pretend to be an expert if you don’t know something. You read some blog posts or few topics today and tomorrow is your interview, during your interview if you throw some buzzwords like “No-SQL”, “Mongo DB” and “Cassandra” then it may backfire on you. You can’t make a fool to the interviewer who is an industry expert, always consider that your interviewer may ask for more details and justification so if you are using technology X or database Y then “why?”, prepare yourself for this kind of question.Do not go into detail prematurely. Many times it happens when a candidate starts explaining one part of the system; they go into too much detail of the component and forget about the strict timeframe and other components. Maybe the interviewer wants you to stop somewhere where they don’t need too much detail. So to avoid this mistake wait for the interviewer’s feedback or response. They will give you some hints or will direct you to whatever part of the system they want you to explain further.Don’t have a set architecture in mind like MVC or event-driven and try to fit the requirement somehow in that architecture. Maybe it’s not suitable as per the requirement. Requirements may change during the interview to test your flexibility so try to avoid this mistake.Be honest during your interviews and if you have never used technology X then you don’t need to be fake in that situation. Try to find common solutions and show them your honesty, confidence, and willingness to learn something. That will make a good impression on the interviewer.Your practical experience, your knowledge, understanding of modern software system and how you express yourself clearly during your interview matters a lot to design a system successfully.\n",

However, nobody wants to get sucked into a major commitment. So, focus on overcoming the obstacles in your path and don't scare away the people who you want to help you. Good luck.\n",
      "模型答案: \"Stupid\" is a little strong, but I don't think searching for a mentor is the right approach. Mentors are great and I've been fortunate to have several (Chris at FSU, Alan at Aurora Biosciences, Ed at UGA, Martin at LLNL). But those relationships worked because I was in close proximity — often the same room — as that mentor, and I could gauge when questions would be unwelcome. I was also able to, from time to time, help them with what they were doing, or at least buy them lunch. If you’re looking for a remote mentor who isn’t at least peripherally involved in your work, I’m not sure how much you’re going to get out of the relationship, or how much they’ll get in return. Rather than searching for a mentor, perhaps look for situations where you can work closely with people who have far more experience than you. University labs are great for this. That approach allows you to asked specific, limited questions rather than asking someone to take on an open-ended “mentorship” role.\n",

Let me explain how it happens. It is 11pm and you are sipping espresso #11 for that day. You see on a presentation that McDonalds had $12 billion in earnings last year. That would go by the untrained person because MCD is a very large company and $12 billion is a very large number. But it immediately catches your attention. That number jumps out of the page. Because you know that large fast food companies trade at about 25 earnings and that would mean that McDonalds has a $300 billion market cap. But you know ExxonMobil is a $300 billion company and there is no way that MCD is larger that XOM. That $12 billion is wrong. All this happens in your head in less than 30 seconds. You look up the correct number (it is about $5 billion), fix the presentation and continue. Perfect number pitch allows you to quickly spot mistakes even if you had no sleep in the last 30 hours.\n",

      "模型答案: If a friend was asking me this, I would probably suggest him to go for TensorFlow. I am super excited about PyTorch, it is a super project, a very promising one! I will definitely give it a try and follow it with attention. In the other hand, TensorFlow is much more mature, documented and there is already tons of tutorials and articles about it. This, is to me, more important for someone asking such a question. Ask me in a year and I would compare performances, features etc. But for now, I would recommend TensorFlow.

I will talk about the differences that I consider are the most important, then give my personal conclusion. The first difference has been, the execution philosophy. In TensorFlow, one must first design the model by running some kind of declarative code and then run it using so called [math]tf.Sessions[/math]. In practice, it makes it harder to debug and really experiment with it.

They would definitely know about Andrew Ng’s ML classes on Coursera and about Weather forecasting using R (if they are serious). Now, I want you to ask yourself: What happens when this field becomes obsolete or congested? What do you do then? What happens if people no more require a data scientist? (This day will probably never come, I am just putting forward an hypothetical case). It took me a lot of time to write this answer and I have tried to provide a comprehensive and holistic approach to make yourself not just capable enough to be a data scientist, but much more than that. Step 1 : Get your mathematics strong and clear. The following topics must be learnt with utmost clarity:Linear Algebra: Start from basic vector spaces and go up to Singular Value decomposition. Don’t underestimate G-S orthogonalization process.Matrix Theory: Learn to find the inverse, transpose, multiplication of matrices, determinants, Eigen values and vectors.Calculus: Integrals (This must be useful ), Differentiation (See here). Differential Equations (See here).Numerical Analysis: Numerical methods to find the solution of a Differential equation and Integrals.Statistics : Distributions, Different kinds of Charts, Mean - Mode - Median (Different methods of finding each and relation between them).Probability : Basic Probability theory, Bayes Theory, What is Likelihood?, Expectation.Don’t overdo the math. These suggestions are based on the assumption that you are strong in high school math syllabus. Step 2: Start reading blogs on data science:This site is like the hub of all data science, ML and AI related posts - KDNuggetsAnalytics Vidhya (See here)Anil Batra’s Blog (See here)BzST (See here)Data Science 101Data TauFor more go here: 90+ blogs on Analytics, Data Science etc. Step 3: Keep up the learning spirit. Keep yourself updated. Keep reading research papers and re-research the sections that you don’t understand. Google all the words and phrases you don’t understand, this process can be frustrating and might force you to go “Fuck this shit! I am gonna go study something simpler”. But believe me when I say that if you cross this phase, nothing can ever beat you. Be a regular visitor of Arxiv, read papers on a regular basis. If you are on Android, Arxiv comes as an Android App too. Step 4: Start some serious data science. (By data science I mean fuzzy Logic, ML, neural nets, AI, NLP etc.)ML by Andrew Ng at Stanford (Please avoid the one at coursera).ML by Abu Mostafa at Caltech.ML at NPTEL at IIT-M (For people outside India, NPTEL is an Indian site where students can see lectures by awesome professors from IITs and other institutes of national importance).Introduction to Data Analytics at Udacity.Introduction to Deep learning at Udacity by Google.Introduction to NLP using nltk-python (here).Introduction to Neural Networks: Book by Simon Haykin. Also learn how to use the neural network toolbox of MATLAB, comes real handy in visualising concepts.Introduction to Fuzzy Logic: Book by Timothy Ross. Same instructions as above.Learning data science concepts and R (or Python) simultaneously at DataCamp.I recently came across this site and this has made me fall in love with it. Check it out here: CodeMentor.Step 5: The Real Action Starts now Now that you are thorough with the basics, dive into making cool stuff with R, Python or any language of your choice. First and foremost let me give a very useful piece of advice. DO NOT TAKE UP A HUGE PROJECT AND END UP DOING NOTHING. Because, let’s face it, you (and me too) don’t have enough patience to sit and face the same dead-end a hundred times. Instead, take up a project and implement one functionality a day. This way you will have a balanced diet for your growing data scientist brain.Learn Numpy (Numpy|Official).Learn Pandas.Learn Matplotlib, Jupyter and Seaborn.These are the basic Python modules for data science using Python. I believe learning R is far easier than learning Python. Most of the R packages required for data science come pre-installed. However, a thorough list is as follows:stringr (string manipulation)Database connection packages RPostgreSQL, RMYSQL, RMongo, RODBC,RSQLitelubridate (time and date manipulation)ggplot2 (data visulization)qcc (statistical quality control and QC charts)reshape2 (data restructuring)plyr (data aggregation)dplyrThere are many more packages, you may explore them in your own time. Tips and Tricks:To save yourself from the hassle of installing so many modules each and every time on Python, use WinPython (download here). This will have most of the modules pre-installed in it and you can also use it in portable mode.For R, download the <package name>-release.zip from CRAN, and save it in a local directory. However, you will need an internet connection to install it, for that you can simply tether your phone’s data to your pc (if you don’t have Wi-Fi).For downloading any package, simply search <package name> Python module, or <package name> R package on Google.After you are done with the above, and if you still have some juice left, dive into the following:Data Visualization: d3.js, tableau, qlikview.Learn Julia.Compete at Kaggle.Learn MongoDb.For any doubts or queries, please comment below.

So, having worked for 6 years at 4 different employers versus one or two would give you the opportunity to apply to the same job. However, during the interviews, you are evaluated on your skillset and your achievements. Certain skills can only be acquired over longer period of times.

Basic Programming Languages: You should know a statistical programming language, like R or Python (along with Numpy and Pandas Libraries), and a database querying language like SQL Statistics: You should be able to explain phrases like null hypothesis, P-value, maximum likelihood estimators and confidence intervals. Statistics is important to crunch data and to pick out the most important figures out of a huge dataset. This is critical in the decision-making process and to design experiments. Machine Learning: You should be able to explain K-nearest neighbors, random forests, and ensemble methods. These techniques typically are implemented in R or Python. These algorithms show to employers that you have exposure to how data science can be used in more practical manners. Data Wrangling: You should be able to clean up data. This basically means understanding that \"California\" and \"CA\" are the same thing - a negative number cannot exist in a dataset that describes population. It is all about identifying corrupt (or impure) data and and correcting/deleting them. Data Visualization: Data scientist is useless on his or her own. They need to communicate their findings to Product Managers in order to make sure those data are manifesting into real applications. Thus, familiarity with data visualization tools like ggplot is very important (so you can SHOW data, not just talk about them) Software Engineering: You should know algorithms and data structures, as they are often necessary in creating efficient algorithms for machine learning. Know the use cases and run time of these data structures: Queues, Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Trees, etc. Product Management: This one is definitely debatable, but those who understand the product are the ones who will know what metrics are the most important. There are tons of numbers one can A/B test, so product-oriented data scientist will pick the right metrics to experiment with. Know what these terms mean: Usability Testing, Wireframing, Retention and Conversion Rates, Traffic Analysis, Customer Feedback, Internal Logs, A/B Testing.\n",

Hence, it is equally crucial to enhance the skills and upgrade ourselves with new ideas. AI can deliver the answer, but it cannot make the logical decisions. There are several jobs that rely on data. It will go in vein without any doubt. As we know, we had a time when we did not have any tools to work, and now we are seeing we no longer need to work. All the work is being managed by machines. For example, we used to have physical newspapers; nowadays we all have smartphones, so we are no longer in need of paper. similarly, such kinds of changes kept on and on. • There are areas where it probably won't work, such as logical discussion or decision-making power. Human intelligence is the most powerful tool than any other. Keep upgrading and learning. Happy reading!\n",
      "模型答案: While automation and AI will undoubtedly greatly impact future jobs, as automation has already done in the past for over 200 years, history suggests that, although the mix of job roles in the economy will undoubtedly change a lot, the overall level of employment will not change very much as a result of automation. I don’t see any dramatic revolution, rather the continuation of a trend that is already well established. Also, although artificial intelligence is an emerging technology, it is only one more in a succession of new technologies that has been changing the economic landscape since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The impact of AI will be of the same kind as we have been seeing since spinning and weaving machines superseded cottage industries a couple of hundred years ago. The general trend is that the essentials of life are being met by an ever decreasing proportion of the workforce, freeing people up to do other things. The economy didn’t collapse when the number of agricultural workers collapsed. Quite the reverse. Masses of workers moved from agriculture to manufacturing. More recently the economy didn’t collapse when the number of manufacturing workers collapsed. Again, quite the reverse. Masses of workers moved from manufacturing into service and professional jobs.

Art, being subjective, will always be valued from actual human hands. The personality and story of the artist is actually part of the art itself. Politician. If we ever give over our governance to AI we are nothing more than pets. Humans must be accountable to other humans. Social worker. I see a problem with an AI intervening in a domestic violence situation, with children present. Don’t you? An AI is not a person. It lacks the social capital needed to leverage clients, service providers, and family. Teacher. Children need to interact with human adults (and other children) to develop properly. Soldier. Much like being a politician, there are constellations of ethical concerns that forbid allowing an AI to *decide* to kill a human. A drone is one thing. An autonomous drone is quite another. Attorney/Judge. Would you be comfortable being defended, prosecuted, or judged by a non-human? Clergy. Would you entrust your soul to a priest with no soul? Sommelier. AI will be able to make very strong suggestions about what flavors go together. It may even develop a sense of taste superior to our own. Yet the vagueness, subjectivity, and ever changing palate of yearly vintages will require a human touch. Trust in your sommelier actually effects your experience in tasting the wine she suggests. Executioner. Like a last meal and access to clergy, the State owes certain considerations to the condemned. One of those is a human hand pulling the trigger, pushing the button, or setting the noose. Doctor. No matter how efficiently an AI might perform a surgery or check medication contraindications, there needs to be a human involved to validate diagnosis’ and bear ultimate responsibility. Rescue Worker. An AI can find where you are buried in a fallen building. It can dig you out of rubble. It can perform CPR. But you will always need a human to tell a parent that their child died, or to comfort a victim during transit. Massage Therapist. The client is paying for human touch. Prostitute.\n",

Say you have a local car dealer who allows you to walk upto him, take a car from his shop and drive to work, and back in the evening. So 20 mins in the morning and 20 mins in the evening, is about 40 mins a day, but you end up having to pay for the whole day. You can do the math (the imaginative kind) and quickly realise it's cheaper to just own this car than to hire it on a daily basis. Now say on the other hand, your Continue ReadingTl;Dr It reduces cloud computing and bandwidth transfer costs. Let me illustrate this with a simple example: say you have to travel to work everyday, which is about a 20min drive. Say you have a local car dealer who allows you to walk upto him, take a car from his shop and drive to work, and back in the evening. So 20 mins in the morning and 20 mins in the evening, is about 40 mins a day, but you end up having to pay for the whole day. You can do the math (the imaginative kind) and quickly realise it's cheaper to just own this car than to hire it on a daily basis. Now say on the other hand, your work is a two hour drive (around 250kms) away. You'd quickly realise it's just cheaper to carpool, and split costs, or ride the train with a seasonal/annual ticket. Now extending this analogy to the computing world: it's often cheaper to own computing infrastructure for regularly performed tasks, which don't require extensive computing resources. Most companies have leases lines, licenses to operate various software. Imagine the bandwidth transfer costs for simple things such as mail servers and DNS queries, which quickly add up in costs, and in the long term, it becomes all the more cheaper, if not essential (due to security and privacy concerns) to perform certain core computing on the premises, while leveraging the cloud for erratic and intensive workloads. (going by my previous example: Owning a train for personal transportation is not a good idea, economically). So edge computing's main proponents advocate, super low latency, lowered costs in the long term, improved safety benefits, and overall a better prospect than transferring the entire IT infrastructure to the cloud. Note: I do not intend to try and dissuade cloud computing. By all means, please leverage cloud computing to maximise efficient utilisation of computing resources. I simply oppose the idea that cloud computing can/should entirely replace on premises edge computing.\n",
      "模型答案: Edge computing refers to a distributed computing architecture that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data and devices that generate them, instead of relying on centralized data centers or cloud computing platforms. Edge computing enables data processing and analysis to be performed on or near the device, sensor, or machine that generates it, rather than having to transmit all the data to a remote location for processing. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected devices, sensors, and machines that generate and exchange data. Edge computing is particularly useful for IoT because it addresses the challenges of latency, bandwidth limitations, and security that arise when transmitting large amounts of data from IoT devices to remote data centers or cloud platforms. By bringing computation and data storage closer to the source of data, edge computing reduces latency and improves the speed of data processing, enabling real-time decision-making and automation. It also reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network, thus reducing bandwidth requirements and costs. In addition, edge computing enhances security by reducing the attack surface of IoT devices and minimizing the exposure of sensitive data to external threats. It also enables privacy-preserving data processing by keeping sensitive data on the device or within a trusted network, rather than transmitting it to a remote location. Overall, edge\n",

Search engines like Google keep these details secret to prevent manipulation, often providing misleading or vague information to avoid system gaming. Recently, there was a leak related to Google's algorithm that sparked significant discussion in the SEO community. HUGE Google Search document leak reveals inner workings of ranking algorithm Known Components of SEO Algorithms:Content Quality and Relevance: Algorithms assess the quality and relevance of content to determine its ranking. This includes keyword usage, content depth, and how well it matches user intent.Backlinks and Authority: The quantity and quality of backlinks to a website are major factors. High-authority sites linking to your content signal trustworthiness and relevance.Technical SEO: Site speed, mobile-friendliness, and proper indexing are critical technical aspects that impact rankings.User Experience (UX): Engagement metrics like bounce rate, time on site, and user interaction are indicators of user satisfaction and influence rankings.Algorithms Vary by Platform:Different Search Engines, Different Rules: Google, Bing, YouTube, and other platforms have distinct algorithms. For example, YouTube prioritizes watch time and engagement, while Pinterest focuses on image relevance and keyword tagging.Content Type Considerations: Algorithms assess text, images, and videos differently. Each content type requires unique optimization strategies.The Role of SEO Testing:Proprietary Information: While some algorithm components are known, many aspects remain speculative, with SEO experts relying on educated guesses and ongoing testing.Running Your Own Tests: An effective SEO strategy involves running your own experiments. SEO experts often maintain a network of test websites to validate theories and stay ahead of algorithm changes.Staying updated with SEO trends requires understanding both the known and speculative elements of search algorithms. Continuous testing and adaptation are crucial for maintaining visibility across different search platforms, ensuring that your content reaches the right audience.\n",

Then I went into management and worked on that for about 3 years and now I am a front end developer and have been doing that for 4 years. Now that I’ve been doing FE for some years I can see in some projects that I’m currently working on how PHP and JAVA have evolved (from when I was a BE developer) and I wish I had more time to learn more and dive deeply into them (again), and specially work on real projects using them. I miss databases as well and I remember I loved to handle complex logic stuff in the BE. On the other hand, I think that FE has evolved A LOT as well in the recent years and now there are a ton of things that you can do and that could be complex and interesting as well (like heavy logic SPAs, dynamic templating, using SASS power to handle things like theming in a nicer fashion, Vue, React, Babel, Gulp, TypeScript) and I enjoy it. Also, my previous experience as BE developer has helped me hugely to be a better FE developer. So, in my humble opinion, I think it depends on what you like more. But if you want to continue working with both, I guess full stack developer is the go to path. However, there’s a downsize to that and it is that I don’t think you can really get to know BE or FE very deeply unless you are extremely dedicated and spend a lot of time doing research and keeping you up to date with trending techniques, tools and technologies. Another point is that if you choose a specific field you’ll be more likely to be specialized in that field after some time and you could earn more money because of that specialized knowledge you have. I am personally thinking to start diving more in native mobile applications or machine learning. But who knows, at the end everything is just code and logic (at least to me) and the nice thing is that we have a lot of options in this field.\n",

      "问题: What are some good whiteboard-based interview questions for screening engineering talent at a startup?\n",
      "标准答案: A good interview is a conversation where both sides do their best to figure out if the opportunity is a fit. Asking questions is essential for figuring that out. Your purpose in asking questions is to get a complete picture of the company and role. The more you know, the more likely you are to make the right decision. The questions you ask will vary depending upon what role you are interviewing for and who you are talking to. A salesperson will want to know different things than an engineer. And you will vary the questions you ask to the founding CEO vs. a recruiter who just joined the company Continue ReadingA good interview is a conversation where both sides do their best to figure out if the opportunity is a fit. Asking questions is essential for figuring that out. Your purpose in asking questions is to get a complete picture of the company and role. The more you know, the more likely you are to make the right decision. The questions you ask will vary depending upon what role you are interviewing for and who you are talking to. A salesperson will want to know different things than an engineer. And you will vary the questions you ask to the founding CEO vs. a recruiter who just joined the company last week. However, no matter what role you are interviewing for or who you are talking to, you'd like to get a good sense of the following 10 things: 1. MarketHow big is the market for the product? How fast is it growing? Is this a stable market or one that is so cutting edge that nobody yet recognizes it's even a market? Is the market focused on consumers or businesses? Does the company have plans to enter new markets? If so, what are they and what is the timescale? Ask which market will you be working in, and what are the biggest opportunities and challenges? 2. ProductHow developed is the product? Depending upon the stage of the start-up you may be interviewing at a firm that only has an idea, or one that has a product that is already well adopted and generating revenues. Is the product going to change? What are it's biggest challenges? Is the company working on many different products or focusing on just one? How will product evolution effect your job? 3. CompetitionWho are the biggest competitors and how are they doing? If there are no competitors, ask why. It could be a sign that there isn't a market. Or you could be taping into a new market, gaining first-mover advantage. If the start-up is going head to head against an established company, it may be tough. Or could signal that the company could be a good acquisition target. Impressive market competition can validate, or kill, a start-up. 4. ClientsIf the company is already generating revenues, do most of the profits come from a certain type of client? Working with the government as a client is going to be a lot different than working with retail consumers. Ask questions about what types of clients use the product. If you are in a client facing-role, ask if you will be interacting mostly over the phone, or in person. Will the role involve traveling to client sites? If so, where geographically are the clients? 5. DifferentiationWhat sets the company apart in the market? Why do consumers chose your product over the competition? Ask about what competitive advantages the firm has. Do they have rock solid patents? Do they have anything truly proprietary? Some businesses are much harder to enter than others. 6. FundingWhat is the current runway? Start-ups vary in funding from being \"paycheck to paycheck\" to having over $1B. Also who are the investors? Do they take an active role? How is your compensation structured? What kind of options are available? 7. Ability to ScaleHow will the company scale as it grows? Does the company have the infrastructure in place to take advantage of the opportunity? Is growth poised to happen rapidly, like a software business? Some start-ups may also be focused on a niche market, and will be unable to really scale and grow. 8. Growth Plans & ExitAsk what the company will look like in 5-10 years if things went according to plan. If it's the plan, what would a successful exit look like? Some founders are looking to IPO, others to be acquired, and others to stay small, nimble, private, and profitable. 9. TeamWhat kind of entrepreneurial experience does the current team have? Have they built successful companies in the past? If the management team has never run a company before and comes in with domain experience only, ask about the management structure. What type of training will you receive? What is the management style? Why is the current role open? Have other people held the role and left? What is the attrition rate at the company? When people have left, where have they gone? 10. CultureAt a start-up, you'll likely be wearing a lot of hats and working closely with different departments and different people. Culture is huge. I would argue the most important thing. Ask about work-life balance. How often do people stay late or work on the weekends? Also, how often do fire-drills happen and what do they look like? How often are people let go? Ask about what kind of person succeeds at the company. Ask if there are any traits in common most people at the current company have. Does the team wear flip-flops or suits to work? Will there be a ping-pong table next to your desk?\n",

Talking, understanding, requirements gathering, enabling communication, business analysis, the ability to do a great presentation to the C-suite, making the complex simple, building cross functional relationships - all great skills that help to generate a great product. Or so you think, until you roll that ever-so-thoughtfull product out globally and you get feedback from people beyond your own walls...your users, your buyers, your subscribers. They will find things you've never anticipated. They will leave scathing reviews or dismiss your product in a 2 paragraph blog. They will break it, delete it, abandon it...or worst of all, ignore it. So, next you immerse yourself in data, trying to understand (or even justify) choices that were made (by the very C-suite you so eloquently informed), review your competitive analysis in an ever evolving dynamic market desperate for a benchmark, learn how to layer business intelligence into data without introducing more of your own bias, (sometimes just getting any data at all!), managing your vendor's aversion to change orders, rethinking your entire internal work flows and creative process, so that you can actually \"bug fix\" or \"hot fix\" the things that were never considered in the first place, learn to ask \"why\" and course correct at the same time, all while trying to make a marketing deadline. Soft skills are extremely important, for sure. But there is more. Psychology, data analysis, actively managing creative teams for success (not just giving them an assignment) and learning to get a superior quality product out the door on time into the market place that is adopted by users requires that you be a coach, an advocate, and sometimes even a drill sergeant. Most of all...you need to learn to compete. You can spend a lot of time acquiring \"skills\" and working on your form, but once you're on the playing field, you need to produce results. You will always fall back to the fundamentals, blocking and tackling, \"understanding\" and \"translating\" but you have to have guts and play to win. Knowing how to \"win\" in the market place is what comes next. This requires \"practice under pressure.\" Winning, by the way, is not about being \"first to market\" or beating the competition...it is about being the best. Putting the best product out, one that is far far FAR superior to the time and resources you were given...that's competing. Getting the product to a place no one could have imagined on your shoe string budget with your broken tools and your tired staff. That's competing. Finding balance, staying calm, thinking clearly...\n",

      "A: This is one of the most common questions I hear from future-PMs. We recently debunked three of the biggest myths about becoming a Product Manager. They might help frame the discussion of how you become a PM. Product Manager Career Path Myth #1: You have to go to school for product management. As Namely’s Brian Crofts explained in our interview with him, he studied economics and finance in college, and his first job out of school was as a finance intern at Intuit.That’s probably far from what most people think is the standard product manager career path. But that’s our point: There really is no such thing as a standard career path for PMs. Some executives, entrepreneurs and product managers will tell you that there is a surefire academic path to a career in product management. Some will argue that you should study business and computer science in college. Others will say that if you want to manage technical products, you’ll need a technology degree, and that if you want to manage consumer products, your best path will be a degree\n",

Let the kids make their own decisions, then review the decision afterwards to discuss if it was a good one or not. They can also practice their communication skills by playing with a toy, telling a story, or even writing a letter to a friend or family member.

      "模型答案: Soft skills, as opposed to technical or 'hard skills,' are defined by the behaviors you exhibit in various situations rather than the knowledge you possess. Personality traits and behaviors are examples of soft skills. Interpersonal skills and communication skills are two more specific types of soft skills that many employers seek in job candidates.

      "模型答案: Which career path is better for long term, a systems engineer or a software engineer? That might depend entirely on your definition of “long term”. I’m a systems architect for a large credit card processor, and I spend most of my day trying to automate myself, and the system engineering team out of a job. In automation, like in all things, it can’t be “turtles all the way down”, meaning they’ll always be a place for systems engineers. However, the skill set requirement and job description of the system engineer is changing rapidly. It’s evolving into something akin to “a systems guy who can code well”. I’m not claiming my experience is any indication of an industry trend, though “DevOps” is most definitely a trend. What I’m seeing, personally in my position, is that Systems Engineers are evolving to incorporate software engineering and development skills on top of their systems knowledge. We are doing this in order to provide products which aid in automation. It seems it’s easier for the teams that already know the regulatory, risk, testing, and other requirements to develop the automation systems, than it is for developers to learn all these requirements and quirks. In this space, at least, we are adopting the ‘data center as code’ mindset.\n",

The argument for paying remote employees more typically comes from the idea that companies are saving tons of money from not needing to rent commercial office space, so that money should be forwarded to employee salaries.

The argument for paying remote employees more typically comes from the idea that companies are saving tons of money from not needing to rent commercial office space, so that money should be forwarded to employee salaries. I actually really like this mentality and think that (some of) the savings from not needing office spaces should go towards employees. However, it’s not as simple as that. When you don’t have an office, you still have “office expenses” * Virtual office platforms. * In-person retreats / travel for team members. * Stipends and other financial support to help employees set up their remote working environments. * Paying for additional backend administration to manage complex employment / contractor contracts (since remote employees may actually end up being contractors / “consultants”) * Loss on currency conversion, depending on which country you’re from and which currency you pay There are a lot of additional considerations a remote company needs to make, which in-office companies get a lot of simply by renting an office.

      "模型答案: I think the startup scene is so dynamic that pointing a particular figure as “the average salary” would be misleading. But let’s try anyway. The average salary for a remote worker depends on certain key factors.The IndustrySome industries are hot right now, and remote workers there command from $80K/year to $300k/year. Some of these industries include AI, ML, and Blockchain. This is of course, in the high end. Some command lower salaries, especially for startups that are bootstrapping. 2. The type of role There are different roles at startups: software engineers, frontend developers, sales managers, product designers, content managers, data analysts, QA engineers, marketing professionals, and more. The type of role will determine the level of salary you command. Looking at somewhere from $36k/year to $200k/year. 3. The level of the role Startups hire for different levels: entry-level, mid-level, and senior-level roles. For entry level, you could get around $36k/year - $50k/year, different for mid and senior levels. In all, it also depends on the industry as I mentioned earlier. 4.

I put Brandon through the interview process like I would anyone else, and never said a word to him about the ETP policy.

The CEO has demonstrably good business and tech skills, but has not founded a successful startup before. The CEO may not be able to attract the level of talent he desires. Potential hires may see the venture as too risky. Salaries might be too low, etc. So the CEO creates a story (which he believes in, to some degree) in which his company is certain to be wildly successful, culminating in an IPO. Salaries are low, hours are long, work environment is chaotic, but the CEO tells potential hires that the stock options included in their compensation package are very likely to make the employee wealthy. We have two potential hires. One is 22 and one is 52. All other criteria (tech skills, etc.) are the same. Which of these two people is more likely to believe the CEO’s story? Which of these two people hasn’t either gone down this road or had close friends go down this road? Which of these two people values optimism in spite of accumulating evidence, almost as part of their personal identity? You can say you don’t know, or that personality traits are distributed evenly, but I believe, in general, it’s easier to lie to kids. Of course, I’m not excusing ageism. The clients that hire me do so in part because they know I’ve kept up with tech advances, and bring experience and perspective to the work. There’s a difference between how we have agreed to behave as a society and pretending that everybody is identical. There are other causes of ageist behavior in the software industry. Some discrimination is based on allowing for other people’s prejudice. A venture capitalist may prefer a young team over an old team (all other things being equal) because he thinks other VC’s may assume the young team understands digital native behavior better than the old team. Even if tech people were generally less prejudiced than non-tech people, there’s still plenty of prejudice left.

I think when it comes down to it, if you love what you do, it is tempting to lose yourself in it. Whether you're working for a hot new startup or starting off as a new professor building a lab and research agenda, the temptation is the same. Loving what you do means you'd happily sink most of your waking hours in, and then wish for more hours in the day. Even more tempting is when you're relatively new to the job and the excitement and novelty has yet to really wear off. Over the last decade or so, I've seen very passionate people go through similar track in both hot startups (Twitter, FB, LinkedIn, Google) and academia: many transitioning from non-stop workaholics into more seasoned, tempered veterans taking a more balanced approach once they hit full professor or high-level manager/director roles. So I think the balance is there for many, it's just a matter of wanting it once we quench some of that thirst and life beckons.\n",
      "模型答案: High tech jobs are pretty good: Flexible hours are here to stay Time off is pretty good at most large corporations (4 weeks and up are not uncommon) Compensation regularly goes up (especially in Silicon Valley) due to competition for employees who have rare skill sets and the intelligence to negotiate their compensation/titles/etc. Set against that are the negatives: On-call rotations are a big part of nearly every role. Face-time is still over-valued compared to productivity. Many companies (e.g., Electronic Arts and some startups) seem to think nothing of burning out their employees only to replace them with new people. Flexible hours means you're expected to work pretty much all the time. Responding to e-mail at 11:00pm just before bedtime is now expected, rather than an exception.\n",

An interviewer, depending on the type of system in focus (eg: legacy vs modular vs object orientated), will determine if a candidate has the appropriate skills according to their judgement, of the appropriateness of the candidates answers to their objective questioning. More important in software development than design, is the ability for a candidate to listen and comprehend end user requirements. An insight: I was once a roving consultant-specialist in a major IT centre and was summoned to a meeting to intercede in a confusion between the end user and a development team. The confusion was because the end user (an accountant) was using terminology unfamiliar to the software developers, and the software developers were talking gobedy-gook that proposed the entire system would need to be rewritten to accommodate the end user requirement. I asked two questions of the end user: the first ”What is it that you need?. I then interpreted his rhetoric and asked for confirmation. The end user requirement was very simple, he wanted a progressive sub-total at the end of each page in a very long report. Why? Is none of the software developers concern! I then asked the software developers two questions: the first “What language is the system written in?” The answer was irrelevant, but pre-emptive for an answer to my next question = “Why isn’t it just a matter of a call to an accumulator & line count? End result: months of proposed work was reduced to at most one day of coding, & testing. There is more to software design than being able to read, write and structure code.\n",
      "模型答案: System design is the funkiest, ill-defined-est of the technical interview questions. Despite that, though, any two experienced interviewers will generally have the same response to how well the candidate did with the questions they were asked; the hard part as an interviewer isn’t so much getting a feel for whether candidates have experience based on their responses as it is recording those responses in a consistent format so that candidates who meet with different interviewers can be compared in a fair and consistent fashion. Ideally, try to scope the question identically across interviewers, and provide a general flow for the discussion. I prefer to constrain the questions to a monolithic application doing some CRUD, but describe the problem in terms of the business problem we’re solving: usually you can pretend there’s a single view out of the application your actual business is solving, and ask the candidate how they’d build that view. Most people can do this: the data comes in from a form on the frontend, we make a request to the backend that contains the information from the form and stuff it in a database, next time you load the page you query the database. The next steps will depend on your organization and the role for which you’re hiring, but you should steer the conversation in the right direction,\n",

I was working on a very cool project, the Magellan 6.5m (now called the Baade and Clay Telescopes, Magellan Telescopes (6.5m)) Telescope for Las Campanas, Chile. I am grateful to have had the opportunity, and this very mechanical portion of my career taught me to make great drawings (at the board and at the computer, this began in 1993 and you would be surprised how many jobs were still drawn with a pencil then…), to be disciplined about engineering science, free body diagrams, considering all factors, and how to say “I was wrong, please show me the right way, sensei.” But then in 1996 I got an opportunity to work as a project/systems engineer in fuel cell technology and have never looked back. In my case a former colleague from the first job contacted me with the opportunity because he new my mind, my style, and my developing skills and thought I was a good fit for the new shop. I never looked back! I have been in fuel cells twenty years now with the partial exception of nearly one year of layoff in the dark times of 2008–2009. Even laid off I was trying to build some startups in Spokane, WA (I could write books about tilting at windmills..but more some other time) and they were loosely fuel cell related. So I think here is the generalization I can make - decide what you want to do. Build a network that can support you and believes in you. Look for your opportunity, and pounce! Never miss an opportunity to strike while the iron is hot… Respectfully, JF\n",
      "模型答案: I transitioned from Mechanical Engineering into other fields of interest in the professional world by going to business school, quitting my engineering job, and enrolling full time at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. While my work does have its challenges, I know I'm happier than I would have been staying in engineering. One driver for my switch was wondering how the business decisions that dictated my engineering work were made. I have a far better appreciation for that now.\n",

      "问题: How do I transition from a product manager for an enterprise software (B2B2C) to a product manager for a consumer internet company (B2C)?\n",
      "标准答案: The essentials of product management are the same across products (and services), but I B2B often has some stark differences versus B2C. B2B products might have hundreds or (a few) thousands of customers, but successful B2C products may have millions. That changes a lot about how you gather market data, think about validation, etc. - A/B testing for websites, landing pages or emails suddenly makes huge sense for B2C. If you have 100k visitors/day to a site, you can do statistically significant testing in hours or days. (B2C sites might have hundreds of uniques per week, which really limits the speed, number and kind of experiments you can run. Likewise if you only send 250 prospect emails/week.) - B2C buying tends to be much simpler: a single buyer, short eval or consideration cycle, much smaller investment. I might buy 15 books/ebooks this month, and not give huge thought to any of them. So UX/UI is all about getting me through the process; headline and layout changes matter; promotions/offers/discounts can have big impact. Etc. That makes attribution much clearer (\"what impact did this change have?\")In contrast, enterprise B2B buying cycles are long, committee-driven, often include shoot-outs/bake-offs/trial periods, may be RFP- or feature-comparison-based, and have to go through a CFO's approval process. So B2B selling is multi-step, multi-persona. We talk about \"users\" and \"choosers.\" Attributing success to any one change in the product/promotion mix is highly suspect in a 9-month sales cycle that includes competing sales teams. - Consumer motivations vary widely, and may not be strictly financial. Athletes buy FitBit because they think it will make them better, somehow, but I doubt many \"run the numbers\" on ROI or incremental fat burnt per $ of product cost. Individuals sign up for cable TV, or online services, or new clothes using some comparative mental value or anchoring price. You'll want to read Daniel Kahneman Thinking, Fast and Slow: Daniel Kahneman: 9780374533557: Amazon.com: Books before doing consumer pricing/buying analysis.In contrast, B2B is (in theory, if not in practice) all about the ROI. Businesses buy products because (a) they expect to reduce costs and save money, or (b) they expect to boost sales and top-line revenue. (a) includes financial software, HR, real estate mgmt, most manufacturing products, etc. (b) includes CRM and price optimization/yield mgmt. So for any sizeable purchase, someone in Finance has to demonstrate some (theoretical) ROI. - IMHO, B2B product managers reflect their market somewhat, approaching their products with B2b-style logic and comparisons/competitive views. They may get a bit emotional about their routers or cloud storage apps, but won't let it show.In strong contrast, B2C folks (mostly, simplifying wildly) F*ING LOVE THEIR PRODUCTS and will talk your ear off about their dating app, or music streaming service, or customizable athletic shoes, or word search game. They have to get into the heads and aesthetics of their customers. Imagine being PM for a line of women's high-performance yoga clothes and not being interested in yoga (or women). Or working on fantasy sports apps but not being a sports fan. So, coming around the long way to an answer, I might suggest studying up on high-volume A/B testing and UX-driven value (versus corporate ROI), getting deep into your intended consumer market (so you can walk the talk and not feel like a fraud), and realize that people buy s**t for all kinds of reasons (which you'll have to care about and understand). Or (if you're like me), decide that B2B is more your style.I've never met a retail store that I liked, or a fashion product that I cared about, or a sport/group activity that moved me, or a design that made me sing. Make sure you're aiming for something that you want and you'll be good at.\n",
      "模型答案: buying process. B2C buying process is fairly well documented and studied and is what is taught in most marketing classes at the undergraduate and graduate level. B2B is very different, and the rise of content/inbound marketing over the past several years has upended the buying process even more by making more information the buyers earlier in the buying process. B2B buying involves multiple personas, stakeholders, and potentially buying centers. It may be influenced by budget cycles within an organization or political issues within a company. B2B product management needs to understand the buying process for a particular product and make sure that the product and the supporting systems around it are designed appropriately. Working with direct sales and channel salesLast, but certainly not least, is the fact that you will be almost certainly working with a sales force in B2B product management while you often will not be in B2C. Many B2C products have no sales force (e.g. SaaS, ecommerce), or the sales force is fairly removed from the development and management of the product itself. Success in B2B product management is nearly impossible without a good relatonship with sales throughout the product lifecycle. I have seen many a good product manager get sunk by not working effectively with sales; similarly, I\n",

Fortune (magazine) suggests that jobs for which there is plentiful, cheap labor will be safe from automation (These Are the Jobs Least Likely to Go to Robots). Line cooks, cleaners, farm laborers, garment workers and other workers with straightforward but not predictable jobs will be safe from automation on economic grounds. One of the possible consequences of of raising the minimum wage would be the newfound economic feasibility of automating such jobs. Any task that butts up against the Uncanny Valley will be hard to replace. People looking to interact with a human will not settle for less. Coach, manager, psychologist, counselor, nurse, and other interactions with some level of intimacy will be hard to replace. Overcoming this barrier has become a huge focus are for Japan, where the demographic inversion caused by low birth rates and aversion to interacting with foreigners has led a concerted effort to build empathy-filled robots for elder care. Japan is running out of people to take care of the elderly, so it's making robots instead. I suspect most societies will have a higher level of resistance to that. Tasks that require a touching people will also hard to automate. A robot dental hygienist, cosmetologist or hair stylist will not be welcomed by many. Same for a surgeon, dentist, or physical therapist. I’m not too keen on some post-Singularity bag of bolts getting too close to me with a sharp object. I’ve seen that movie. Artists of all sorts will be hard to replace, whether performers, sculptors, painters, chefs, musicians, or writers. Though some AI bots have taken to authoring technical papers and books, it’s not clear how the distillation of human experience to encapsulated works will be readily replicated in the near future. Anyone who will tell me, “but, Deep Dream!!” I will refer to their nearest local art gallery for rehabilitation. Or force them to listen only to Compressorhead performances for the rest of their lives. If all else fails, the last human work will be a Blade Runner, though some cinephiles suggest it has already been automated.\n",
      "模型答案: AI and automation will have a significant impact on software jobs. As AI and automation continue to advance, it is likely that many software jobs will be replaced by machines. However, it is also possible that new jobs will be created to support the development and maintenance of AI and automation systems. Overall, it is important to continue to monitor the impact of AI and automation on the software industry and to adapt to changing job requirements accordingly.\n",

These are different forms of communication, but the process of bringing them to fruition has a necessary, sometimes overlooked step: editing! Unless you’re a professional writer, it’s unlikely that you have an editor who can review your writing regularly. Here are some tips to help you review your own work.Give your writing some space. Have you ever felt a mix of pure relief and joy when you’ve finished a draft of something? Don’t downplay that feeling and the ability to walk away from your work before you start editing it. You may need minutes, hours, or days, but once you sit back down with what you originally had on the page, you’ll have the thrill of looking at it with fresh eyes. You’ll notice errors you may not have seen the first time. You’ll come to new realizations about its overall tone and structure. If it’s a text or email, maybe you only need a few minutes away from it. If it’s a story or essay, perhaps you’ll need longer. Regardless of what type of work it is, it will help your writing tremendously.Don’t use overachieving synonyms. Looking at your work for the second, third, or fourth time around may inspire you to spice up your language with longer, more uncommon words. There’s nothing wrong with having a thesaurus nearby, but try to limit the repetition of long, pretentious-feeling words so your work flows well and doesn’t feel too bogged down. At the end of the day, you want it to feel true to you and the message you’re conveying.Remember who the reader is. Don’t forget your own voice as the writer—but don’t forget who your reader is. Many writers get too close to their work; editing is a chance to try to get out of your own head. Who is your ideal reader? What do you want them to take away from the writing? It’s a unique time to step in their shoes, to make sure your communication is as effective as you’d like it to be.Kill your darlings. Don’t be scared to remove chunks of your work, even if it feels precious to you. If it’s a passage that’s really tough to part with, try saving it somewhere else, so you can return to it later in your piece or for another work.Use Grammarly. Last but not least, Grammarly has countless resources for editing your work. Our writing assistant helps you find areas of your writing that are unclear or too wordy, as well as help you find mistakes you might not have caught.Editing may feel tedious, but it’s just as important as writing itself.

Here are the tips to prepare you for better prospects.Learn the basics: While you are visualizing yourself standing among the future software engineers and developers with a hefty salary package, make sure that you are not missing out the basics.Have real world experience: Get a hands-on experience in your college itself and do what the employed people do. The chances of your success depend critically on how soon you act on your ambitions.Don’t skip classes: Skipping some academics and bunking lectures for hanging out in the canteen is a fun. If you want to be successful, start creating essential work culture right in the college.Depend on yourself: Teachers may guide you to some extent. But you must have self-learning ability and are capable of working independently.Don’t depend on college: The college doesn’t care if you wish to learn Python when Java is on their curriculum. It is not their concern what kind of career you wish to have. it teaches you things that it wants to, instead of what you want to learn. So, self-learning is not a skill to be learned but a habit worth inculcating.Use proper tools: There are many tools for learning tools such as Visual Studio for C++, C#, mobile and game and web development, Android Studio for mobile development, Netbeans for web development, Komodo Edit for Python, PHP, Perl, Go and Ruby, and so on.Prioritize activities: Set your priorities and start with them instead of trying to do everything at once. Focus on a specific set of activities. This way you will actually do things and finish in stipulated time.Get interested in other skills: The computer-lifestyle is not always fun. Playing a musical instrument won’t assist you in creating the next e-commerce platform, but it definitely enhances your creativity. Writing a novel or technical article cannot help you in establishing the tech pioneer, but it can surely add sparkle to your life.Sharpen soft-skills: Your success depends on your character and ability to negotiate with people. Your personality, thoughts, and interaction convey a lot about your chances of fitting into others culture, and that is what companies search in their employees.Find what recruiters look for: Companies expect you to be capable of implementing what you have learned. They analyze you completely within matters of minutes and draw their conclusion. I interviewed thousands of CS professionals, not only for their technical skills but also their attitude.Try real life projects: Instead of routine academic projects, look for some real life or innovative projects that enhances your chances of getting job easy for you.Get online help: Whenever you are stuck, seek help from your friends, teachers, and search on Internet. Mostly likely you get help. When I proposed about 30 names for my company, the registrar rejected all names, saying that a company with such exists in some part of the world. Finally, I proposed a name for which Google did not show single entry, and it was accepted.Be curious: Look at the child. They never stop asking why things happen like that. Think of yourself as a curious child, jump into the world of explorations, and test your aptitudes.Learn as much as possible: I learned, taught, developed, and wrote a book on C++. I requested one of my former colleagues to develop my company’s website. He developed some designs. I did not like any one of them. Finally, I designed company’s website myself by learning necessary stuff, html, CSS, JavaScript, C# etc. Sometimes, it is cool when you can do multiple tasks by yourself without relying on anyone else.Passing test is not end: It may not take much time to learn something new and passing the examination. But mastering it takes a lot of time. There are people who have good experience in what they do and have spent a few years of their life doing the same things over and over.Know latest trends: There is a lot happening everyday in computer world: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Speech Recognition, and so on. Read blogs and research articles about latest trends. Know your industry and aware of what is happening around you.\n",

When you go to anyone with skills in machine learning, or ask for advice in this subject, you will hear a lot of ohhs and arghs about how complex it is, you need to spend endless months and years understanding the basic dynamics, etc. Except for statistical anomalies, it’s rubbish. Let’s take you through the evolution, you have someone who designs a strategy, the Strategist, they ask the question. You then have someone who develops the algorithm, the Implementation or programmer, they provide the answer. The Architect, Quant in the finance world, sits in the middle with some Strategist (business) and Implementation (technical) skills, they provide the Solution. Bir Zos's answer to How do I become a millionaire before the age of 30? Each skill uses a different tool, the Strategist will use things like Bloomberg or Office tools to find business datasets. The Quant will use tools like R, Python, Matlab, Tensorflow, and Implementation will be C++ or similar. None of them speak each others language, so obviously you have a lot of “lost in translation”. The point is to make money, you need to find statistical probabilities that others miss (a reversal), or where the mass jump on board and you bought early (Bitcoin). When we started using machine learning we did not fully appreciate the core limitation, you need to actually know the boundaries of the Answer. Most people will say, I want machine learning to find me the best price that makes the most money. Fine, but what is “best price” and what is “most money”, a 2% move, a 5% move, a 10% move, and therein lies the fundamental problem, you have to contextually provide a boundary, which requires humans, and experienced ones at it. What happens when you get that boundary wrong in machine learning, you have financial flash crashes, and Teslas crashing in to random objects in the real world, it is why the financial markets are so highly regulated, to “remove” the boundary problem. Except human nature will always find a way to break an algo, either by mistake or intentionally. Given that humans are hideously inefficient these days, it’s not complex to make a machine learning algo, the problem comes with the boundaries, however humans these days are also hideously inexperienced so wouldn’t know a boundary break until a long time after the event. Which is least worse, today that is machine learning algos, they are incredibly stable until they break and then it goes horribly wrong rapidly. We were in discussions with Matlab about their product for machine learning, saw a demo and had a conference call, we were told it was the complete end to end cycle, Strategist to Implementation. Fine, except after explaining how we use institutional grade products one of the reps said, is it too expensive. Obviously they had never head of tools such as SAP, this raised our alarm bells. It turns out Matlab as a Solution only truly solves the Quant part, but tries to solve the Strategist question and Implementation answer. In this case the Strategist still has to code for the machine learning, and the Implementation can only handle 24 “objects” per server, since we trade twelve timeframes per instrument, C++ it is not. In machine learning you need to evolve from the Strategist to Quant to Implementation, all the tools out there make it very difficult to machine learn the data without the technical knowledge, this means that the dataset from the Strategist only has a 50% chance of success, then the Quant 80%, and the Implementation 95%. So we went on a journey, and found a way to machine learn without coding, be 95% accurate in the data, pass that to Architecture for 99% accuracy, and then to Implementation for 99.9% accuracy. I spent some time this weekend testing a dataset, took a few hours, no coding, found some anomalies, which showed up a minor anomaly in our algos, and are revising the dataset to account for it to prove feasibility. Then will spend a few days implementing it in a 4GL for proof of concept, and then a few weeks in to a 3GL for Implementation and production, in total hours, days, weeks. In a standard environment it will be weeks, months, quarters, or even months, quarters, years. So you ask, what is the Solution, funny, our process is 10x to 100x more efficient than the institutions, but I will provide the Answer, they are all off the shelf tools with default settings applied. You just have to evolve the datasets, like a Reverse Osmosis process, the problem is finding the exact combination of tools so one flows to the next. Machine learning can be used in any and all environments, fraud, risk metrics, analytics, trading, however focus will always be placed on the area that makes the most money with the least effort and least risk to capital. I have been asked to perform Strategist, Architecture (Quant), and Implementation work for external funds and institutions (yes I have the rare skill I can do all three). After looking at their environment they all had one thing in common, they were hopelessly inefficient and I really had better things to do, companies pay you based on their inefficiency, not on your efficiency. Which is why the world has designed QE, because if it was not there I can promise you all the recent stock markets gains, all the hedge fund wealth, would never have existed, all the time making the poor poorer. The machine learning algos are there to make incremental income from the slow and steady flow of money from QE, by knowing exact unchanging boundaries, however there is one thing algos can’t do, and that is offset human stupidity, they have a habit of magnifying it.\n",
      "模型答案: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses historical data to analyze patterns and make predictions in finance. It is an algorithmic trading technique that can automate the process of analyzing market trends and making trading decisions based on historical data. Machine learning models are trained on historical data to identify patterns and make predictions about future market movements. However, it is important to note that machine learning models can be complex and require significant computational resources to train and optimize. Additionally, the use of machine learning in algorithmic trading is not without its risks and challenges, as demonstrated by the experiences of some traders who have invested thousands of hours into this process without achieving significant returns.\n",

Tensorflow is for rapid asssembly, tuning and distribution of conventional models. It’s got a big menu of well-known components. From Convolutional Nets for image recognition to Recurrent Nets for language and anything else you might read about. Grab it, stack it, and you’re off. You’re free to play with hyper-parameters all day long, do Data Analysis to search for hidden signals, gaze at awe-inspiring visualizations on a gizmo called TensorBoard. Just don’t try to get too close to the whirling blades of any of those components. If you try to, say, build your own optimizer you will hit a Brick. Fucking. Wall. Say hello to Tensorflow’s static graph. You say you want to do a calculation, and would like to know the loss from layer 3 to feed an equation? Yea, no. That value doesn’t exist yet, it’s stuck in this graph structure and scheduled for later. No, you can’t change the structure. What you gotta do is, OK - make a placeholder, or maybe a variable, or I think it’s a slot … anyway, you need to create a Tensorflow session so that you can run evaluate … Oh - and Python debug breakpoints won’t work anymore. So things can’t see other things. And you can’t see them either. You’re going to need an old priest and a young priest. Oh! But TensorFlow just launched Eager Execution in version 1.13 that fixes all that so you can program ‘imperatively’ (a polite term for not needing an exorcist.) Yea, no. Eager Execution will slow your model down by a factor of 20. Two hours just became two days. Forget about it. Tensorflow is like a bus. A great way to get a bunch of people to a well-travelled destination. PyTorch is like an all-terrain vehicle. The best to go exploring off the beaten path.\n",
      "模型答案: Both TensorFlow and PyTorch are excellent frameworks for machine learning, and the choice between the two often depends on your specific needs and preferences. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide: PyTorch:Ease of Use: PyTorch is generally considered more user-friendly, especially for beginners. Its dynamic computation graph allows for easier debugging and experimentation.Pythonic Nature: PyTorch feels more like standard Python, making it easier to learn and integrate with other Python libraries.Community and Research: It has gained popularity in the research community, leading to a wealth of cutting-edge models and papers being implemented in PyTorch.TensorFlow:Production-Ready: TensorFlow is often preferred for deploying machine learning models in production. It has robust tools for model serving, such as TensorFlow Serving and TensorFlow Lite.Ecosystem: TensorFlow has a broader ecosystem, including TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for end-to-end ML workflows and TensorFlow.js for running models in JavaScript.Keras Integration: Keras, which is now part of TensorFlow, offers a high-level API that simplifies building and training models, making TensorFlow more accessible.Recommendation:For Beginners: Start with PyTorch if you want a more intuitive learning experience and are focused on experimentation and research. For Production: Consider TensorFlow if your goal is\n",

Let me tell you three ways I have used Machine Learning.To improve what I already do. When I first applied serious data analysis to my trading I identified 36 discrete trading strategies I implement and ran numbers on four aspects of applied trades: What to risk, When to take profit, Profit:Loss ratio, Slippage. With this analysis, I emphasized some trades more than others, tightened or loosened my risk tolerance, and so on. Total profits increased by 50%.To automate what I already do. Computers do not have the same breadth of judgment that I do, but they can learn to copy my best stuff. We used what’s called Supervised Learning, meaning that we showed it a bunch of my trades and asked it to create a copycat algorithm. It finds more opportunities than I do, and can manage more positions, though it doesn’t trade them quite as well. Total profits increased by 30%.To expand what I already do. We started with things I already trade on and added a couple that I suspected were useful. We fed that through a neural network, which means that it combines those inputs and gives them each various weightings — then rinse and repeat a few times — to generate new strategies. This becomes exponentially effective the better you do it, so the first rollout produces little profit, the next a bit, then finally a lot.In doing all of this I’ve learned two really important things. Until we reoriented our thinking about how to move forward, we were trying to fill the ocean with an eyedropper. We needed a tool more suited than an eyedropper and a goal more concentrated than the ocean.The trader’s key skill is to distinguish signal from noise. Use it. Most people think they’re going to throw reams of raw data into a computer and it will spit out brilliant trades. The possibilities are too expansive for this. The trader's skill must be applied to reduce problems by orders of magnitude. Which predictors will we use? Which moving parts of strategies do we want to move? How are we going to cluster strategies?It’s harder to define what a good strategy is than you would think. “Maximize profits” or “minimize losses” sounds great, but there are ups and downs in any trading strategy’s life. It matters whether its losers are too big or frequent, or if its meaningful winners are too infrequent. So we started using our own eyes to compare profit/loss distributions of strategies applied to sample data, rather than trust it to pick the best strategy on its own.Best wishes!\n",
      "模型答案: I don't think it's 'foolish' for a Financial Engineering student not to learn Machine Learning. However, I think the uses for it in finance are wildly overstated. The dreamy eyed kids of the engineering department imagine that AI and ML systems will eventually be managing all portfolios, identifying and managing all risks and basically eliminating all the jobs on Wall Street. It's never going to happen. It may be used in some fringe specialty firms or in small dollar amounts, but because it obscures risk by its basic design, it will never be accepted as a means of portfolio selection by the institutional side of the finance industry. For financial engineering, it might be slightly more practical. I can imagine a few circumstances where there might be some benefit to trying it out. I'm only spitballing here, but suppose you were trying to model some aspect of a pool of securities and trying to classify them into different groups that weren't readily apparent, in order to determine which model should be used for them in pricing and settlement. That might be a place where a ML system could help. But for 'trading'? Not a chance. That doesn't make it a waste of your time, or 'foolish', but as a rule I'd say ML and\n",

No. Not even close. I think there are at least three categories of people who are asking this question over and over.Young students who are worried about what they should study. And they are worried, mostly, because…Older students and adults who either failed to take, or outright failed, engineering classes, are hoping their failure has been made irrelevant, and between their wishful thinking and schadenfreude they keep making unsupportable claims about AI making engineering irrelevant.Unscrupulous CEOs who are trying to get more investments in their AI companies.AI has positive applications. Don't get me wrong. But all of the hype that claims AI will replace engineers of any flavor is effectively a fabrication that isn't based on reality. In my own domain of software engineering, I've played with the tools. Yes, I've used GPT-4. Yes, it can be useful as a “smart documentation lookup.” But no, it won't replace any engineers. It can't even perform an absolutely brain-dead simple conversion of a trivial script from one language to another without writing code that could not possibly have worked under any circumstances—and that's the easy part of the challenge. Current AI tech understands nothing. When stringing together words, it often sounds decent. But it's only spewing words that seem to fit well together. Words that are effectively stolen from actual humans, but that are used with zero understanding. One of the brain dead Quora Prompt Generator (an AI they use to write questions) questions was about how to travel to Quebec from Canada. In case your geography is rusty, Quebec is in Canada. So the question makes no sense. But for fun, I dropped it into ChatGPT, and it happily told me about several ways someone might travel from Canada to Quebec. Zero. Understanding. It's a magic trick. A very good one, in some cases. But it's all an illusion. What shocks me is how persistent the doomsayers are. How they'll throw code at me that was generated by so much question text, you would have been better off writing the code rather than the English, and then point at it to say that AI will replace programmers. When only a programmer could have written that English to begin with. 🙄 And when every experiment I've done the code generated has been awful, or wrong, or entirely inappropriate. They natter on about my lack of skill at ”prompt engineering” being why my experiments fail, without even recognizing the irony of the situation: If they have to write in highly specific language to produce the correct result, then they've simply created a new, poorly defined and sometimes inaccurate, programming language, and are claiming that it's somehow better than the well defined languages we've been using for years. And more importantly, the code generation that it only barely gets right is the easy part of being a software engineer. Creating an architectural design and knowing what code needs to be written are also necessary skills. Not to mention requirements gathering and interviewing the client to gain an actual understanding of their needs. Which, as I've said, current AI cannot have.Please, if you comment to disagree and tell me that AI will, in fact, take over the world any day now, let me know which category you're in. It will influence my reaction to your comment.\n",
      "模型答案: No, not in the near future. AI will replace some jobs, but not all. It will also create new jobs. For example, there will be more demand for engineers who can work with AI systems. Additionally, AI will lead to the creation of new jobs in fields such as data analysis, machine learning, and data science. However, it is important to note that AI will also create new challenges and opportunities for engineers.

However, to learn good writing, the most crucial part is implementing these concepts. So, practice is the key, but if you practice writing incorrectly, you do not land anywhere.

      "标准答案: The key factor in your situation is that you'd like to join a startup (and what sounds to be a fairly early-stage startup?) In that case, your best bet is to clearly and convincingly display that you have the skills and drive to that startup, with a highly targeted exercise that demonstrates effort, drive, and insight. The reality of a startup is that job requirements are pretty fast and loose - things are moving quickly and the checkmarks on your resume matter much less than your ability to quickly jump in with whatever the crisis of the moment is and contribute meaningfully.

In that case, your best bet is to clearly and convincingly display that you have the skills and drive to that startup, with a highly targeted exercise that demonstrates effort, drive, and insight. The reality of a startup is that job requirements are pretty fast and loose - things are moving quickly and the checkmarks on your resume matter much less than your ability to quickly jump in with whatever the crisis of the moment is and contribute meaningfully. An example of something you might do to stand out: do a deconstruct of their product, or a particular feature, or even something small/specific like a sign-in flow. Concrete proof like that speaks way more than your resume. Target this work towards what the startup is working on, and (if possible) what they are trying to hire this PM for. So for example, if you are looking at an K-12 educational tech startup that is hiring a PM to help them acquire and retain users, look at, say, the newest feature that the Khan Academy launched, deconstruct it, and describe how it it is going to improve (or not improve) key metrics like course completion rates.\n",

      "模型答案: Okay, I'll try help. First though, you need to learn and do a few things, before you can start building a career in machine learning. Here are the steps.Get Data. The hard thing about machine learning is that you need lots of data, which can't come out of thin air. I recommend going to Kaggle, which has lots of data. As a bonus, you can partake in competitions when your good at machine learning, and earn Hella money on it.Learn a programming language. Since you don't have a programming experience, learn some python, it's the easiest and most useful language for machine learning. Its also the language that helped build giants like GPT. Try gain proficiency in it tooLearn the necessary python libraries. Learn libraries like pandas, matplotlib and scikit learn.(3.5) Along the way on learning machine learning, you'll need to learn a lot of math. Machine learning at the end of the day is just Hella maths. So learn linear algerba, calculus, statistics, probability, etc (who knew high school maths has a use).Now that youve got the basics down, (you've mastered the libraries and gained a solid grasp on the maths), time for some deep neural networks and learning\n",

      "标准答案: 0.1% (junior engineer) to 1.0% (lead for entire product) depending on seniority of the position. 0.5% is not atypical for positions requiring 7–10 years experience, 0.25% two previous jobs. 0.1% doesn’t become reasonable for a senior engineer until you have $10M in annual revenue and 50 employees. That’s usually after series B or C. Some organizations offer less because their business does not require good engineers solving challenging problems, they don’t value engineers, or are naive about running startups and more likely to fail. All those reasons suggest considering employment elsewhere.\n",
      "模型答案: The number of stock options a Senior or Lead Engineer receives when joining a startup can vary widely based on several factors, including the stage of the startup, the company's valuation, the role's seniority, and the overall compensation structure. Here are some key considerations: General GuidelinesStage of the Startup: - Seed Stage: Typically, options can range from 0.5% to 2% of the company. - Series A: Options often range from 0.25% to 1.5%. - Later Stages (Series B and beyond): Options might be lower, often around 0.1% to 0.5%.Role and Experience: - A Senior Engineer might receive 0.5% to 1%. - A Lead Engineer may receive 1% to 1.5%, reflecting their greater responsibilities and impact.Company Valuation: - Higher valuations can lead to lower percentage equity offers, as the overall value of the company is greater. - Conversely, early-stage startups with lower valuations might offer higher percentages to attract talent.Total Compensation Package: - Stock options are often part of a broader compensation package that includes salary and benefits. It's crucial to evaluate the total compensation rather than just focusing on stock options.Vesting Schedule: - Standard\n",

One-Time Effort, Lifelong Benefit 🌱 Mastering DSA & System Design requires a one-time effort but benefits your IT career for the next 18 years. Even if you switch jobs later, you can revisit your previous preparation and tackle any interview confidently 💪. While you can't completely avoid recessions in IT, thorough preparation enables candidates to quickly pivot to another top tech company if impacted 💼.\n",
      "模型答案: It’s natural. From cutting time of going out, skipping the gym, quitting a hobby, a good coding interview preparation requires at least a few months of sacrifice and dedication. The scope of the interview is so wide from Coding questions, system design, Object-oriented design, project knowledge, and Language specifics that if you have put so much into it, then you are bound to be nervous. The best way to overcome is to practice and get interviewed as many times as possible. Solving questions in an interview is different than at your home where nothing is at stake. Eventually, you will figure out a pattern in all the coding interviews. All the best for your job quest.\n",

Too often, do i hear the stories and see how people - they work in things akin to yielding Ego or subjugating their team unto the dirt, to be a winning strategy. The thing is, we have to account for our fellow humans, in a correct matter. Respect. Cooperation. Focus on the real tasks.Coding: Same as for understanding Mathematics.Social Adaptivity: So, this one is a bit odd. But it stands true, none the less. You want to be socially flexible. Combine this with a thirst to learn, as in always being pragmatic.. And you’re set.\n",

Do not miss a day. It’s really important to be consistent with this!Some of those will turn into leads, for which you’ll learn about the problem, propose a solution, and provide an estimate for the work.Some of those will turn into accepted work.Repeat until you retire. :D\n",
      "模型答案: Becoming a freelance tech consultant involves several steps to establish your expertise, build a client base, and manage your business effectively. Here’s a comprehensive guide: 1. Identify Your NicheSpecialization: Focus on a specific area of technology where you have expertise, such as software development, cybersecurity, cloud computing, or IT strategy. Market Research: Analyze the demand for your skills and identify potential clients or industries that may benefit from your services.2. Build Your Skills and ExperienceCertifications: Consider obtaining relevant certifications to enhance your credibility (e.g., AWS Certified Solutions Architect, Certified Information Systems Security Professional).Portfolio: Create a portfolio showcasing your past projects, case studies, and any relevant work experience. This can include personal projects, volunteer work, or freelance gigs.3. Set Up Your BusinessLegal Structure: Decide on a business structure (e.g., sole proprietorship, LLC) and register your business if necessary.Finances: Open a separate business bank account and consider using accounting software to manage your finances.

So, have various “no code required” mechanisms. We are just barely getting to the paperless office, which has been promised for just as long.

Here is how you do it: 1.) Find a mentor - find someone (or multiple people) in the IT world that can guide you. Meet with them on a semi-regular basis. They can give you good advice and it will start to build your network. If you are lucky you will find one that can be your mentor and can help groom you for the IT world. Invaluable are tips on everything from dress, how to dress up your resume, how to interview well, current topics, good disciplines, etc. 2.) Pick an area of IT and start ‘owning it’. By this I mean learn everything you can about it, get your hands on some equipment and start building a lab. You would be shocked at what you can do for next to nothing. Some examples:Old, crappy, derelict PCs and laptops that people dump at Best Buy - you can install Linux or even VMware on them and you have a free server that you can use for a variety of purposes in your education. A 10-year old desktop system can be made very useful for your purposes and really helpful learning hardware. And if you blow it up….nothing lost. Same goes for networking gear like switches, routers, etc. You can pick up dirt cheap or free Cisco gear if you know were to look. Ebay can help, your local electronics recycler can too. Watch for companies dumping servers. A large company in my area frequently dumps gear at….get this…GOODWILL. I’m talking 3 or 4 year old Dell servers, storage arrays, all sorts of stuff with PLENTY of life in them.Many companies have software emulators for IT components. That means they can be hosted and work exactly like their hardware counterparts. These emulators are very good, sometimes functional equivalents, and they are dirt cheap to free. Examples of this are just about any Cisco networking gear, storage subsystems, and load balancers. You can put some mighty powerful architecture together with spare gear and emulators.If you have a home PC, or laptop - virtualize it. It will give you the ability to run multiple servers and operating systems on the same piece of gear.Ask your friends for their old gear. This is never fail - someone always has something laying around that can be helpful when learning.3.) Pick an area to study and work on getting a certification. I recommend the following:First - study for the CompTIA A+ certification. Easiest to study for, great intro into IT and computers. There are no shortage of books, online courses (live), YouTube videos, and computer-based learning available to help. Again, try to do it as cheaply as possible.Next, get another certification in the next level of something that interests you. Good next steps: - Linux - Windows - Networking (Cisco CCNA) - Virtualization (VMware, or open source systems like Xen or KVM) - Storage Administration4. ) Once you get some certs (and you are keeping your mentors up-to-date on what you are doing), start looking at temp employment agencies (like Manpower), IT consulting companies, staff augmentation firms, etc.. Get a sharp resume together, list your mentors as references, start circulating it. 5.) Read, Read, READ! 6.) Network, Network, NETWORK! Attend any IT-related user groups, conventions and vendor shows in your area. They are great networking opportunities as well as great places to learn. Most are inexpensive or free. 7.) The most important thing to reminding yourself - You can do this!! As someone with over 30 years in the industry, I can tell you all you need is attitude and aptitude. If you can learn, and you have an attitude that you will find a way no matter what…you can make a great career at just about anything. If you do the above, I would be surprised if you did not have an IT job in one year or less. I have personally seen it happen numerous times. There are far more free or cost-efficient ways to educate yourself today, meaning it is much easier than before. A degree helps, but it is not necessary in this field. I make more than most doctorates in my field, however I only have a community college degree to my name. (BTW, I highly recommend your local community college, or places like Strayer. They are cost efficient, have a ‘consumer’ attitude toward your education. (Meaning they are taking your money, they owe it to you to try to teach you something. This is different than a university where most of the time they feel it is a privilege for you to hand over your money to them, results be damned.) While skills like public speaking, presentation, technical writing are very important, you don’t need to mortgage a house for a degree to get them. And you don’t necessarily need them to land your first IT job. As for my bar worker - fifteen years later he is the Sr. Network Admin at an expensive private school pulling down some serious coin with a small team working for him. He will retire well…. Good luck! ********Update:My bar worker friend just retired. He married a lady who has a nice job, so he is doing freelance work when it suits him. He picks the projects and the clients to work with - hard to beat that.In the timespan since I first wrote this article, I hired a guy who was working as a security guard, went to school for law enforcement…and hated it. I had him do the above ~exactly~ as I described, and now he is working for me doing integration work on a joint defense contract. In the span of 2.5 year he is now engaged, has bought a house, and is doing really, really well making a terrific salary in an employee-owned company. He is a valued member of my staff and will have a stellar career here. He did come in with the benefit of having taken writing, speech, and presentation classes in the course of his degree, however he had zero IT experience. You can get the ‘soft skills’ at a community college at a bargain.My nephew was a narcotics officer in Atlanta barely making enough to keep his family of four going. He did the above, except in project management, landed a job in the construction industry ~in one week~ and is now 7 years later is making 4 - 5x what he was as a law officer. I could write a book on his incredible story and transformation. The above can work with any career. And never underestimate the power of a desperate person. Go watch the movie ‘The Pursuit of Happiness’ to get an idea.If you are reading this, you may be on the cusp of a great turning point in your life. Commit to it! Pursue it! Make it your driving motive every day. It will be a great adventure, but someday you will look back on it as the moment you decided to write your future.

      "问题: Do interview questions for data science positions focus on data structures and algorithms?\n",
      "标准答案: As other people mentioned, it depends a lot on the company. I only once applied for a more or less pure data science position. In other cases, they wanted some domain knowledge related to, e.g., vision, NLP, and/or robotics. However, in most cases they would carry out a Google-style algorithms interview, where you write code either on the whiteboard (most common case) or on the computer. I got some basic math questions too.\n",
      "模型答案: No, not necessarily. The focus of interview questions for data science positions can vary depending on the company and the specific role being applied for. Some companies may focus more on data structures and algorithms, while others may prioritize problem-solving or domain knowledge. It's important to research the specific company and position requirements before preparing for the interview.\n",

As a backend developer, let me talk about the other side. 7-8 years ago when IE was the leader of the browser sector, it was really a hard thing to work on front end. Even Chrome and FF were different in some attributes. So many backend developers were trying their best not to be part of front end job. Today, differences in browsers are so few, if you know some tricks you can fix differences in the end. Once I was so afraid and scared of CSS, now it's fun for me. Once you are a programmer, you'll be a life-time-student. If this disturbs you, don't start with programming.\n",

In a year, I usually have 2–4 engagements where I get paid, and I usually make 4–5 figures. To be transparent, my minimum is $3000 and I’ve made as much as $25,000. Conferences are willing to pay $1000-$10,000 for a keynote, and for more substantial work, like a workshop, you could command as much as $25,000. Here are two key things you need to do if you want to get paid:Always ASK! When the next speaking opportunity comes along, always start with the question: “Do you have a budget for speakers?”(Sidenote: This question is most appropriate when an event organizer approaches you with an offer to speak.) If they say no, don’t be discouraged; it often simply means that they need to go and find out whether they can pay you. If they say yes, then you can dig into how they allocate their budget: travel, hotel/accommodation, meals, and speaker fee are common categories. Keep these in mind when you negotiate your overall price. Some people will tell you upfront what they’re willing to pay speakers, but most will want you to throw out a number first. In negotiation, this is called setting an anchor. I hate having to set the anchor, but often I do.Price yourself relative to their revenue. My formula for setting a reasonable anchor has been to ask whether the event is charging attendees, and if so, how much are they charging and how many people will be attending the event. Multiply the two numbers together and you’ll get a sense of gross sales for the event. Then I’ll ask anywhere from 1 to 10% of what I think their gross sales will be. If they have sponsors, I push it close to 10%, because usually sponsorship is used to cover speaker fees.To give you a ballpark, if I’m speaking at a Fortune 500, I typically charge at least 5 figures, especially if it’s for an internal event or keynote at a conference. For smaller conferences, I charge no less than $5k plus hotel and airfare. For those who cannot afford that, I’ll typically just ask for hotel + airfare minimum (unless it’s truly a pro bono situation). Remember that you’re charging because it enables you to give a fantastic, memorable talk. The conference organizers want to give their attendees a great experience and raise the overall caliber of their event, and they have budgets to make that handsome. A tip: It helps to send over sample of previous talks. Generally, people are unwilling to pay 4 or 5 figures if there is no record of you speaking and they’re hosting a high-profile event.\n",

I’ve earned over $1,000 in one month without ‘living’ on the platform. I was skeptical right up until the moment I cashed out to my PayPal. What is Freecash all about? Basically, it’s a platform that pays you for testing apps and games and completing surveys. This helps developers improve their applications while you make some money.You can earn by downloading apps, testing games, or completing surveys. I love playing games, so that’s where most of my earnings came from (oh, and my favorites were Warpath, Wild Fish, and Domino Dreams).There’s a variety of offers (usually, the higher-paying ones take more time).Some games can pay up to $1,000 for completing a task, but these typically require more hours to finish.On average, you can easily earn $30–50/day.You pick your options — you’re free to choose whatever apps, games, and surveys you like.Of course, it’s not like you can spend 5 minutes a day and become a millionaire. But you can build a stable income in reasonable time, especially if you turn it into a daily habit. Why did I like Freecash?It’s easy. I mean it. You don’t have to do anything complicated. All you need is to follow the task and have some free time to spend on it. For some reason, I especially enjoyed the game Domino Dreams. My initial goal was to complete chapter 10 to get my first $30, but I couldn’t stop playing and ended up completing chapter 15. It was lots of fun and also free money: $400 from that game alone.No experience needed. Even if you’ve never done any ‘testing’ before, you can do this. You get straightforward task descriptions, so it’s impossible to go wrong. A task you might expect is something like: Download this game and complete all challenges in 14 days.You can do it from anywhere. I was earning money while taking the bus, chilling on the couch, and during my breaks.Fast cashing out. I had my earnings in my PayPal account in less than 1 day. I’m not sure how long it takes for other withdrawal methods (crypto, gift cards, etc.), but it should be fast as well.You can earn a lot if you’re consistent. I’ve literally seen users in the Leaderboard making $3,000 in just one month. Of course, to get there, you need time, but making a couple of hundred dollars is really easy and relatively fast for anyone.Don’t miss these PRO tips to earn more: I feel like most users don’t know about these additional ways to make more money with Freecash:Free promo codes: You can follow Freecash on social media to get weekly promo codes for free coins, which you can later exchange for money.Daily rewards and bonuses: If you use the platform daily, you’ll get additional bonuses that help you earn more.In-app purchases to speed up processes: While playing, you can buy items to help speed up task completion. It’s optional, but it really saved me time, and I earned 4x more than I spent.Choose the highest-paying offers: Check New Offers and Featured Offers to get the best opportunities that pay the most.Honestly, I still can’t believe I was able to earn this much so easily. And I’ve actually enjoyed the whole process. So, if you’re looking for some truly legit ways to earn money online, Freecash is a very good option.\n",

You will sometimes feel lost and helpless and like your opinion doesn't matter. Especially when you are a junior.You will probably be assigned menial work in the beginning. Big companies are generally reluctant to throw juniors at the hardcore technical stuff.It can be hard to negotiate big jumps in responsibility and salary because of the bureaucratic nature of big companies.Small companies Pros:You will probably get to work with interesting technical stuff straight away. Small companies don't have as much money or time to spend on mentoring and trainee activities. Everyone needs to contribute to the core activities.You can quickly get more responsibility and higher salary if you perform well. In small companies you have a direct line to senior management, and they have to power to elevate you without worrying too much about company policies.There is generally less paperwork, silly rules, boring HSE drills and awkward talks about core values. It's more of a no-nonsense atmosphere.Cons:It's more difficult to hide from your responsibility. While it's easier to be recognized for good work, it is also harder to hide when you underperform.Small companies will sometimes push you to accept less than market value salaries if they think they can get away with it. They are often so restricted on budget that have to find ways to keep salaries down.If I were to highlight one point on my list, it would the fact that you get to work with more advanced technical stuff right away in small companies. That can give you a huge edge later in your career. Big or small, in the end you should go for the company where you will be working on the things that interest you and that you enjoy.\n",

Then there are the lower level managers who may be younger and feel intimidated by someone older than them, think something must be wrong with the older person because they should be more advanced than them at their age, or also just think, “ew, old, gross”. Tech companies used to be fine since nerds respect age, but the tech boom has turned it into Logan’s Run for millennial yuppies. They think everyone being young and most of the employees looking attractive and trendy (except the engineers) are what’s going to lead to success, pretty ridiculous. Outside of tech, teaching and politics are well known for respecting age. An older person is often seen more favorably than those younger.\n",
      "模型答案: Age discrimination may exist in Software engineering, but it's probably not the main reason why developers tend to be young. Stack Overflow's 2015 survey of more than 25,000 developers revealed that, yes, developers tend to be younger. Here are some possible explanations for this:Software engineers often move into management.Software engineers make a lot of money and are able to retire earlier.In the developing world, where about 80% of people live, software engineering only recently became a viable career.The world population skews young. The average human being is only 30.Software engineers may burn out before they reach older age.And your reason: employers may discriminate against older software engineers.For every company like Facebook that wants to train recent graduates from the ground up, there are many more companies that value experience. I have a friend in her 50s who just accepted a software engineer job at Apple, for example. Also keep in mind that while you may have nailed some interviews, most organizations are conservative, and err on the side of not hiring. I have plenty of friends in their twenties who just *knew* they nailed their interviews, only to get passed over. They just dust themselves off and keep interviewing elsewhere.\n",

The man reason is robberies of people. Credit cards are on the way out. Because of over charging the use of one. It has nothing do do with credit checks of the individual. If you go to a store and buy a box of cookies for five dollars. That same box of cookies can cost you twenty five dollars. A debit card is used like cash now of days. The transaction is almost at the original price or at the original price at the store. Many people in our nation is getting away from the use of credit cards. Because they are simply saving money. A lot of bus companies are doing the same thing. Instead of cash they are using a debit card. Which people who use a bus to go to work are placing money on those cards. If you are thinking of working for a credit card company. I would look into one that Handel's debit cards. In about 40 years or so. You may be looking for another job and you may not even have a pention or a retirement fund except Social Security. Well I got to go stay well and be happy.\n",

The work will be more complex than entry level today, largely because the easy to automate roles will be a mixture of software, sensors of some sort that need maintenance, compute hardware or services, and humans combined for whatever a business or group are trying to achieve. The whole notion of a fully automated Leisure world is nonsense: it is going to be a mishmash of “standards”, regulations, enforcement, and varying levels of “working at all or just normally super buggy” causing everyone’s lives to be an absurd comedy.

So here’s how I go about it. When it comes to salary, most of the times, it’s that one HR recruiter who decides your pay.

You said you hContinue ReadingMy friends often seek my advice on quiting job and negotiating salary. I have helped many! I have quit my job way too many times and my last change was with a 95% hike! So here’s how I go about it. When it comes to salary, most of the times, it’s that one HR recruiter who decides your pay. You have to rip her (almost always, her) confidence apart right in the interview room. How you project yourself :- Wear decent cloths, not superfluous. Business casual is perfect. I don’t wear full sleeves for interviews. Learn to project yourself as I-mean-business guy than I-need-a-job junkie. You said you have good language skills, use every sentence to impress your HR recruiter. Business idioms are best to grab her attention. Use your body language as well. If you are sitting across the table, lean forward, keep both your elbows on the table. Be mindful of your body language. Do these help you get a better salary? No, it’s just for an impression. Skills - most important thing :- If you are unskilled, nothing would save you, Period! You mentioned that you know some advanced technology. Fair enough! Do you have something to show off on your github? Have you created something of your own? Do you have a contribution to some popular tools? Do you have a technology blog? Have you won some tech challenges? Have you highlighted all this, whatever applicable, on the front page of your resume? Remember, only you will see your potential, ie, what you are capable of doing, everyone else judge you by what you’ve already done! Sad truth. So get some shit done! No excuses here. Don’t ask for a job, go sell yourself :- This might sound clichéd, but very important. The difference is, when you walk into the interview room, do you feel you desperately need that job? Failure! You should think why this company should be desperate to hire you. It must be so. To make this point clear - every HR interview begins with a bit of suffocation. And the plot is that the company is selling a job, you are there to buy it. You’ve gotta flip that! You’re selling something hot and the company would benefit from it. Funda of sales! So turn it around! But in the beginning, she is psychologically at a higher level and you’re at bottom - that’s how it’s staged. Rip off your HR interviewer’s confidence. There are many ways. For example, she would probably talk about the work-life balance at her company and how you could benefit from that! You might want to say ‘wonderful!’ Don’t! Listen intently, patiently until she stops, then ask her - ‘Every other company has this to offer, tell me something that makes you outstanding? I’m curious!’ Say that with wide-open eyes. Your goal is to bring her down! Be cautious to be polite! Research her company's competitors, and find out what, where they lack. Use them against her to put her under pressure. Listen so intently that you should find something to use against her. This will work in your favor. Speak, speak, speak :- HR recruiters follow 80–20 rule. She speaks 20%, you 80%! Use it wisely. Inflate your profile. First bring her down to your level (psychological), then go above her! Ask all sort of questions. You want to know everything about your prospectus employer! Watch her struggle to answer your genuine questions that you would like to know of her company and the opportunities once you join them. You should invoke a guilt in her that this qualified chap has other better options, better companies than the one she represents. The more you put her under pressure, the more you get out of the interview. After this, when she takes the conversation to your salary expectation, be bold and ask, like you’re worth it. Be clear about your expectations. If you're not bold, it’s easy for her to negotiate. You should ask the maximum her company can give the best candidate for the job you’re applying. If she refuses and asks if that’s negotiable, tell her you may consider that. This is only for not getting rejected right away, just in case what you asked for is impossible. But don’t ever settle for less. Your goal here is to get the offer, whatsoever. Negotiation :- If you get an offer letter with less than what you expected, reject it. Don’t give reasons. If you get what you asked for, reject anyway. Your goal here is, get her coming back to you. Tell her, while you were waiting for her offer, you got a better one. But you would still like to join her company (for all that work-life balance and shit), if she could reconsider your package! If she asks you to disclose the new offer, just remind her that all offer letters are confidential. Tell her that you’re still interested in her offer. Now you have turned the game upside down. You are selling yourself, she’s the buyer! Well done! Go shopping :- Once you have an offer, go shopping with it! You’re on the safer side. Ask for more, just walk in the interview room and demand. Be ready to walk away, too. Tell them, buy me for what I sell you for, I’m on my way to glory! I declined my Accenture job offer with one word in the reply email - ‘Rejected.’ I got a call from HR in 10 minutes. Now, at this moment, she was asking me to reconsider, and I was to decide. This is how you flip it. However, I had my toughest negotiation with Accenture HR. We were struggling to conclude and I hang up the phone saying ‘You decide the best you can and let me know, you will have my final answer in 10 minutes.’ I assumed I was out of the game, but I got an amended offer letter. We compromised - both of us, and I accepted that offer. After few days of my joining, using ‘thank a colleague’ portal, I sent her a ‘thanks’ to let her know she was impossible! Disclaimer :- Be extremely cautious to be polite and soft-spoken! You by no means offend the HR recruiter. Be curious with every question you ask. Also, this may not always work. If you’re applying a job at best engineering companies, don’t play this! Be responsible for what you get in return. Reject some offer anyway! Feel awesome that way (like a boss)! She may ask you to leave the room, expect that as well! But try again! If you don’t risk it, you ain’t gonna win it.\n",

If you're looking for a job that offers more flexibility and work-life balance, then negotiating a higher salary may be worth it.

      "问题: Is developing apps a good side hustle for earning extra cash?\n",
      "标准答案: Developing apps? No. That isn't a side hustle… that is a time consuming job that takes years of education and machine learning. Selling affiliate apps or websites to small businesses on a good affiliate program? Absolutely. We even use the term “side hustle\" in Smartr Marketing because so many people started referring to our company as a side hustle.\n",
      "模型答案: Yes, it can be a good side hustle for earning extra cash. However, it requires a lot of time and effort to develop apps and there is no guarantee of success. It is important to have a solid understanding of coding and design before starting to develop apps as a side hustle. Freelance app development can bring in decent side income, but it is not a guarantee of success. It is important to focus on freelance work and building a portfolio of work before trying to land a full-time job in app development.\n",

You can see career transitions in 2 major types: lateral or vertical. Lateral are ones where the skills needed are typically much more concrete. These could be things like moving from a frontend engineer to being a backend engineer. Or working on things like data pipelines as a data engineer. The exact skills here and available options for them are a bit numerous to list here, but of you have specific fields I’d be happy to talk to you more about what they would be. For vertical transitions up the career ladder you’re typically looking at developing more soft-skills after a certain point. I’ve worked primarily as a backend engineer, so can really only speak about those movements specifically. But they would generally be something like:Entry-level to Mid-level: Able to work with less well-scoped problems. Understands the types of questions to ask to product and how to navigate the company to find information out.Mid-level to Senior-Level: Able to learn how to design systems within their team and lead projects. Skill growth here is centered around knowing design patterns and scaling software, as well as cross-functional interaction and communication.Senior-Level to Principal/Staff: Able to work across teams and make longer-term technical decisions. This is more about scope and ability to lead across teams working on multiple distinct technical stacks.\n",
      "模型答案: A software engineer can make a variety of career transitions, depending on their interests, skills, and goals. Some common transitions include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Software Development to Management: Engineers can transition to management roles, where they take on leadership responsibilities and drive team performance. Required skills include project management, communication, and strategic thinking.\n",
      "2. Software Development to Marketing: Engineers can transition to marketing roles, where they focus on promoting and selling software products. Required skills include marketing strategy, product development, and data analysis.\n",
      "3. Software Development to Operations: Engineers can transition to operations roles, where they focus on ensuring the smooth running of software systems and processes. Required skills include system administration, process optimization, and resource management.\n",
      "4. Software Development to Research and Development: Engineers can transition to research and development roles, where they focus on developing new software products and technologies. Required skills include problem-solving, technical expertise, and innovation.\n",
      "5. Software Development to Data Science: Engineers can transition to data science roles, where they focus on analyzing and interpreting data to drive business decisions. Required skills include data analysis, statistics, and machine learning.\n",

This involves doing compiler works.A lot of task require you designing an appropriate domain specific language. And so an adequate compiler has to be designed.So, for compiler jobs my recommendation is to extend your search to slightly different jobs than just the ones you may think about. About operating system, this is a different game. Linux has made many of those jobs obsoletes. But there is a lot of system programming jobs and also drivers jobs. For your job search I advise not to be too selective, apply to the jobs offer that you would accept. If you really really want only compiler and operating system, there would not be many. I don’t want to say by that, that learning compiler and operating systems is a bad idea. To the contrary, it is really useful. But the usefulness is that it allows to understand a lot of things.\n",
      "模型答案: I can only speak for compilers. Employers see compiler engineering skills as specialized and difficult to acquire or teach. The result is that they mostly want to hire people who already have experience, so the first job is the tricky one—compilers are hard to get into, but once you’ve had one job in the field, it’s usually pretty easy to get another. There are a few routes into the field that I’ve seen work:Advanced education: Get a master’s or doctorate in computer science or a related field, and do research relevant to computer languages. I saw one candidate literally give a talk about his thesis on his interview day.Internship: Intern with a compiler team and make a good impression. Preferably, keep coming back to the same team and doing good work; by the time you graduate, they’ll be eager to hire you.Transfer: Work on some sort of developer tools team that’s adjacent to a compiler team and volunteer for tasks that build relevant experience. When there’s an opening on the compiler team, they’ll be interested in you as a candidate.Open source: Make contributions to an open-source compiler and establish a track record as a skilled and thoughtful contributor; then apply to commercial teams who work on that compiler.These routes are not mutually exclusive\n",

      "标准答案: Write tests for your code. I wrote a longer answer about this here.Do not expect to be given much instruction about how to program in a CS school. Other than some basics, your professors will likely focus on concepts and leave implementation to be a self directed activity. If this bothers you, you may not be cut out for CS.Focus on taking the classes where you will learn the most. Never ever take classes based on how easy it is to get a grade in them. It is much more important to learn a lot than to worry about grades. The ideal scenario here is to take a class where you push yourself to learnContinue ReadingWrite tests for your code. I wrote a longer answer about this here.Do not expect to be given much instruction about how to program in a CS school. Other than some basics, your professors will likely focus on concepts and leave implementation to be a self directed activity. If this bothers you, you may not be cut out for CS.Focus on taking the classes where you will learn the most. Never ever take classes based on how easy it is to get a grade in them. It is much more important to learn a lot than to worry about grades. The ideal scenario here is to take a class where you push yourself to learn, and still get great grades. It is very doable. Don't take short cuts in learning. ( e.g. See: Which is more beneficial to learn as a first programming language, Java or C++? Why? ).Always try to build a unified view of computer science from the different classes that you take. Your Theory of Computation class can teach you something valuable for your Compilers class. Your algorithms class is related to your graphics class. Your graphics class is related to your linear algebra class. As and when there is an overlap of knowledge in different classes, use that overlap to your advantage to continually reinforce your learning. Pre conditions and post conditions you learn about in correctness proofs of programs map directly to asserts. Keep on collecting pieces of the puzzle and keep putting them together.Do not sacrifice theoretical learning for implementation centric learning, and vice versa. They are both duals of each other, and not at odds with each other. If you sacrifice theory, it will deprive you of a much needed analytical framework to rigorously scrutinize the complexity of algorithms. If you sacrifice implementation, you might as well be a math major specializing in discrete math. Likewise, do not sacrifice depth for breadth or vice versa.Don't fret about ignoring your non CS classes, particularly if you want to work in the industry. I didn't pay attention to many of them, and had B's bogging down my GPA but whatever.Your algorithms, OS and compiler classes will likely be your most important classes. Don't just stop at what your teacher tells you, be a sponge and absorb anything and everything you can learn about those topics. They will stand you in good stead for a long, long time. ( See: What skills do self-taught programmers commonly lack? What should a self-taught programmer study to get up to speed with his/her formally-educated peers? )Choose your collaborators and study partners well. They can really inculcate the right mindset for learning in you.It helps to develop good relationships with your professors, on multiple fronts. It generally feels good to look back and reflect on how you didn't think of people that you learnt from with a sense of hostility. This is very important if you want to apply to graduate school, want to do research with a professor or have them help you publicize jobs for your company when you are later working in industry.Not generic to CS, though it goes without saying that you should establish good friendships. Your college friendships will last a long time, and will be a social network as well as a professional network for a lifetime.Try to get your programming projects done well in advance of deadlines, ideally have them ready for submission a week in advance so that you are always debugging and programming with a relaxed mindset. Make backups of your work out of paranoia.Participate in programming competitions if you can. You have nothing to lose, and pushing yourself to learn will be helpful. ( See: Does ICPC or IOI success correlate with industry success? )Your first job or other pursuit after school will be very formative. Be sure to invest appropriately in ensuring you choose well. Naively picking the job that simply maximizes your paycheck may well be a sub optimal decision.Spend time going the extra mile to learn about your OS ( What are some time-saving tips that every Linux user should know? ), your debugger ( eg: How can one become as efficient at using GDB as in using a visual debugger? ) and your editor ( e.g. What are some favorite Vim commands (no plugins, no mappings, etc.; only things you can type in a factory-fresh install)? ). They can be very useful for improving your productivity and what you learn you get to keep.At the end of the day, you should realize that a large part of your education is teaching you how to learn to learn rather than specific coursework.It’s tempting at times to write programs that satisfy your project requirement, and could get past TA grading, but won't meet the cut for a real program. E.g. it’s easy for you to create memory leaks in your assignments and get full credit for it, though try to push yourself to do a good job here and try to be a perfectionist in whatever code you do control.Make good use of opportunities to listen to lectures and talks that aren't a part of official coursework. In the case of particularly prolific speakers, one good talk can influence your thinking for a lifetime. Some Dijkstra lectures I attended still echo in my head.\n",
      "模型答案: before you start coding. I think this is the most important thing you can do to improve your coding skills. It is very simple, but it will make a huge difference. 1. Take a coding boot camp course (or two or three). This will teach you the basics of programming. 2. Learn a programming language. There are many different languages to choose from, but the most important thing is to pick a language that you enjoy. You will spend a lot of time coding in this language, so it is important that you like it. 3. Practice coding. Coding is hard, but it is also very rewarding. You will make mistakes, but you will also learn from your mistakes. 4. Read books and articles about coding. This will help you learn more about the language you are using, as well as other languages and techniques. 5. Work on your problem solving skills. Coding is all about solving problems, so it is important to practice this skill. 6. Learn about design patterns and other programming techniques. These techniques can help you write more efficient and elegant code. 7. Practice debugging. Debugging is an important part of coding, so it is important to practice this skill. 8.

      "标准答案: There is an approach called \"working backwards\" that is widely used at Amazon. We try to work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features. For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customContinue ReadingThere is an approach called \"working backwards\" that is widely used at Amazon. We try to work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features. For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions. If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!). Here's an example outline for the press release:Heading - Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.Sub-Heading - Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.Summary - Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.Problem - Describe the problem your product solves.Solution - Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.Quote from You - A quote from a spokesperson in your company.How to Get Started - Describe how easy it is to get started.Customer Quote - Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.Closing and Call to Action - Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call \"Oprah-speak\" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's \"Oprah-speak\", not \"Geek-speak\". Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, \"Are we building what is in the press release?\" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).\n",
      "模型答案: By using AI to scale yourself and refine your thinking. I’m not sure who said it first, but it’s a common idea now that AI will bifurcate current software engineers into “10x engineers” and “replaced.” We’re only in the early stages of that now, but it’s a pretty common take that AI will make engineers much, much faster and more effective for those who wield it well, and those who fail to wield it will be left behind. Although it’ll likely take longer, the same dynamic will exist for PMs. I’m probably missing some categories of how PMs should be making the most of AI, but my rough thinking right now falls into “self-scaling” and “refining thinking”. Self-scaling Essentially “making yourself faster.” Current generative AI still needs your oversight and wisdom to be useful, but it can make you much faster by doing some early, tedious iterations for you. Some of the most impactful activities you can outsource to AI:Parsing through user feedback or other content, either to label it or extract relevant quotesData pulls / coding / scriptingWriting first drafts of communications, internally or to customersRefining thinking Now that you’re faster, some ways to be better:Research.

Don’t like marketing? Get used to it. Customers do NOT just come to you. So either you do the marketing directly, or you spend a bit less time marketing, and use 3rd party brokers (they’ll call themselves “consulting firms” but they’re really staffing brokers) to do the marketing for you (and pay them 20%-30% of your billing rate to do so). $$$ - When you factor in all the time it takes to run your business, marketing and sales, and down time (where you’re available but there is no client, I plan 3 months down time total per year), PLUS the cost of running the business and providing your benefits (want a vacation, YOU pay for that. Want insurance, or retirement? On you). And don’t forget the extra business taxes, business taxes, corporate fees if you incorporate, and the extra 7.65% of income that goes for the BUSINESS share of soclal security and medicare (employee pays half and employer pays half, now you’re both). And the same income and other taxes you pay now of course. It’s what explains all those high rates. A rule of thumb is that you need to bill 3 TIMES what you want to take home to cover everything and the down time. So, to be self-employed really means starting and running a small business. And it’s NOT easy. And honestly, all the hassle and uncertainty is why MOST software professionals that try it end up taking a job again. Much easier, and you may even make more money.\n",

But you know how it is – the internet is full of scams and shady-grady stuff, so I spent weeks trying to find something legit. And I finally did! Freecash surprised me in all the right ways. I’ve earned over $1,000 in one month without ‘living’ on the platform. I was skeptical right up until the moment I cashed out to my PayPal. What is Freecash all about? Basically, it’s a platform that pays you for testing apps and games and completing surveys. This helps developers improve their applications while you make some money.You can earn by downloading apps, testing games, or completing surveys. I love playing games, so that’s where most of my earnings came from (oh, and my favorites were Warpath, Wild Fish, and Domino Dreams).There’s a variety of offers (usually, the higher-paying ones take more time).Some games can pay up to $1,000 for completing a task, but these typically require more hours to finish.On average, you can easily earn $30–50/day.You pick your options — you’re free to choose whatever apps, games, and surveys you like.Of course, it’s not like you can spend 5 minutes a day and become a millionaire. But you can build a stable income in reasonable time, especially if you turn it into a daily habit. Why did I like Freecash?It’s easy. I mean it. You don’t have to do anything complicated. All you need is to follow the task and have some free time to spend on it. For some reason, I especially enjoyed the game Domino Dreams. My initial goal was to complete chapter 10 to get my first $30, but I couldn’t stop playing and ended up completing chapter 15. It was lots of fun and also free money: $400 from that game alone.No experience needed. Even if you’ve never done any ‘testing’ before, you can do this. You get straightforward task descriptions, so it’s impossible to go wrong. A task you might expect is something like: Download this game and complete all challenges in 14 days.You can do it from anywhere. I was earning money while taking the bus, chilling on the couch, and during my breaks.Fast cashing out. I had my earnings in my PayPal account in less than 1 day. I’m not sure how long it takes for other withdrawal methods (crypto, gift cards, etc.), but it should be fast as well.You can earn a lot if you’re consistent. I’ve literally seen users in the Leaderboard making $3,000 in just one month. Of course, to get there, you need time, but making a couple of hundred dollars is really easy and relatively fast for anyone.Don’t miss these PRO tips to earn more: I feel like most users don’t know about these additional ways to make more money with Freecash:Free promo codes: You can follow Freecash on social media to get weekly promo codes for free coins, which you can later exchange for money.Daily rewards and bonuses: If you use the platform daily, you’ll get additional bonuses that help you earn more.In-app purchases to speed up processes: While playing, you can buy items to help speed up task completion. It’s optional, but it really saved me time, and I earned 4x more than I spent.Choose the highest-paying offers: Check New Offers and Featured Offers to get the best opportunities that pay the most.Honestly, I still can’t believe I was able to earn this much so easily. And I’ve actually enjoyed the whole process. So, if you’re looking for some truly legit ways to earn money online, Freecash is a very good option.\n",
      "模型答案: Yes, there are job opportunities in data analysis that do not require knowledge of programming languages such as R or Python. Some examples include data analyst, business analyst, data scientist, and data engineer roles. These jobs are very data-driven and require working with data from existing business systems or data scientists, and often involve working with customers to help them make business decisions with data. Some of these jobs are at risk as dashboarding systems get more and more self-serve, but the reality is, many people need help understanding and interpreting data, and that where you could come in, if you have a decent background in quantitative thinking, but don’t want to be a programmer.\n",

As I have been driving a software development company and being a Tech Leader for quite a time, I have discovered my definition of seniority cause I have to hire, train and mentor them. So I was always curious why some software development companies cost so low compared to San-Francisco Bay developers. Why does the price differ from 10$ per hour up to 150$ per hour? You learned algorithms, computer science, frameworks, and languages. Your debugging skills are excellent. What else should You as a developer accomplish to cost so high? Of course, living costs differ, but is there a secret? It's business analysis skills. A good developer is not one who wrote a lot of good code. The senior developer is the one who writes code that solves exact business problems. You should understand the business domain and know how to ask your business to understand the issue you are solving. And only after that we choose the tool, approach, and framework and create a complex solution. Without all of that, you are just a \"coder\". The coder is the one who is told to write code, and he writes code. The code is clean, covered with tests and maintainable. But it has zero business value. Sometimes Senior developers can avoid development at all by simply asking the right questions to the business. It's an amazing idea that software developers can bring benefits by NOT writing code but instead asking the right questions. In fact, this ability lets your business avoid micromanagement. Instead of asking you, \"Please create a REST API that can handle user creation\" business would tell you, \"We need to be able to register new users\". Then it's your turn to identify the need and decide what kind of API is needed. Maybe business need \"forgot password\" functionality as well? Maybe 2FA? Connect with SSO providers? So your price is defined by that quality. It's elementary to find a coder, that's why it is cheap, but it's tough to find a developer who asks questions and knows the business. This is what I define as seniority.\n",
      "模型答案: Here, in my opinion, the most underestimated factors: 1) constant changes in existing technologies. This requires the developer to continuously improve, in order to remain in the professional trend. Many programmers think that their professionalism is an established thing and do not accept changes. 2) knowledge of standards. Most programmers are sure that software development is creativity. In fact, this is clearly a standardized process. Without an understanding of these standards, professional growth becomes impossible. A programmer begins to feel like an \"unrecognized genius.\" 3) ability to work in a team. With this, I do not mean the general phrase from the training :) In the case of the developer, this concerns knowledge of different models and methodologies. Such as Agile, SCRUM, Kanban, Waterfall etc. This is needed in order to more efficient interaction with colleagues. You will also begin to understand the logic in the actions of project managers. It really makes life much easier and the work is more professional. 4) IP Rights knowledge. Software development is the creation of intellectual property. You must understand the rules and processes in the field of what you are dealing with. This will help you become not just a performer, but a complete professional.

      "问题: I am going to pursue my MBA in finance and I wish to do both CFA and FRM in the long term. What should I start with, CFA or FRM with my MBA?\n",
      "标准答案: Short answer? Yeah, that’s a red flag. When I first started getting serious about my finances, I didn’t even know what a fiduciary was. But once I understood the difference between a fiduciary and a “regular” financial advisor, I realized just how big that gap is. Honestly, it can mean the difference between growing your wealth and getting taken for a ride. So let’s break it down. A fiduciary is legally required to act in your best interest. Not just “make recommendations” or “offer options.” They have to put you first. That means they can’t steer you into high-fee products just to earn a commissContinue ReadingShort answer? Yeah, that’s a red flag. When I first started getting serious about my finances, I didn’t even know what a fiduciary was. But once I understood the difference between a fiduciary and a “regular” financial advisor, I realized just how big that gap is. Honestly, it can mean the difference between growing your wealth and getting taken for a ride. So let’s break it down. A fiduciary is legally required to act in your best interest. Not just “make recommendations” or “offer options.” They have to put you first. That means they can’t steer you into high-fee products just to earn a commission. They’re held to a much higher ethical standard, and if they screw that up, they can get in serious trouble. Now compare that to a non-fiduciary financial advisor (which, by the way, includes a lot of people who call themselves advisors but are really more like glorified salespeople). These folks often work under something called the suitability standard. That means they only have to recommend something that’s “suitable” for you, not necessarily what’s best for you. Big difference, right? Here’s an example: Let’s say there are two mutual funds that do the same thing. One has low fees, and the other has high fees and pays the advisor a commission. A fiduciary would steer you toward the low-fee fund because it’s in your best interest. A non-fiduciary? They’re allowed to recommend the one that pays them more, even if it eats into your returns. And the worst part? A lot of people don’t even realize this is happening. That’s why, in my opinion, working with a fiduciary is non-negotiable. You want someone who’s legally and ethically on your side. Someone who wins when you win, not when they sell you a product. If your current advisor told you they’re not a fiduciary, I’d seriously reconsider that relationship. You’re trusting this person with your money, your goals, and your future. Don’t settle for anything less than someone who’s 100% in your corner. If you’re ready to find a fiduciary advisor near you, I highly recommend checking out ComparisonAdviser. It’s a free tool that connects you with real fiduciary advisors. These are people who are vetted, experienced, and legally obligated to do what’s best for you. Takes less than a minute to get matched, and honestly, it could save you thousands down the line.\n",
      "模型答案: When deciding or advancing your career path, it is of paramount importance that you make informed decisions. Choosing an option is still easier as compared to actually committing your time, money and effort to earn the credential. The differences of the 2 qualifications can be looked at as:To summaries, choosing between the two programs boils down to an individual’s interest and focus. CFA has a global appeal and opens the door to job opportunities in investment analysis, portfolio management, insurance sector, hedge funds and others. CFA level 1 training is provided by many institutes like IMS Proschool and others. If you want to pursue employment in credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and other risk management professions then FRM is a good program. However, since it is a specialised program, there are very few jobs available in India. Therefore, a better option would be to go for CFA. The images below show the number of jobs available for both the qualifications in India:\n",
      "The answer to this question depends on the individual's interest and career goals. If the individual is interested in risk management and related fields, then FRM may be a better option. However, if the individual is interested in investment analysis, portfolio management, insurance sector, or other financial related professions, then CFA may\n",

Students should be interviewing shortly after graduating the bootcamp, which should be facilitated by the bootcamp if they have the relationships and presence in the market. It is also assumed that we are talking about web development positions and the demand continues to be strong and growing in both areas.\n",

      "标准答案: Hello, yes, job hopping is looked down upon as a software engineer, as it shows you’re not a stable employee not worth hiring because you’ve no loyalty to any employer. Looking for a short time increase in 1–2 years vs sitting in a position for 4+ years and building up your skills, experience and knowledge with one company shows that you cannot make commitments for the long haul.

Looking for a short time increase in 1–2 years vs sitting in a position for 4+ years and building up your skills, experience and knowledge with one company shows that you cannot make commitments for the long haul. It costs money to train, develop employees so that an employee needs to stay a few years before the employer can recoup the cost. On the employee’s side, it takes a few years to develop before one develops the necessary skills, knowledge, expertise to move to a more senior role either inside or outside the company. Job hopping for the sake of a few more thousand dollars in 1–2 years won’t help you develop those skills you need to grow and develop as an engineer. It takes a steep learning curve to learn the ways, culture, processes, skills needed in a new company, which you don’t need when you’re trying to do your job. Try to stay at least 5 years in any role starting off if possible, unless you’re a poor fit for the company. The best situation to leave a company is if you get a promotion elsewhere after at least 4–5 years. Always leave jobs on good terms with your previous employer before moving on. Job hopping will create acrimony with employers and give you a bad name for being a flake.\n",

But over time, I realized ML is not as tough as it looks—if you approach it the right way. So let's break it down into a learning path, which actually worked for me: 1️⃣Phase 1: Get your foundation strong Before you jump into the neural nets, make sure your ML basics are clear.

But over time, I realized ML is not as tough as it looks—if you approach it the right way. So let's break it down into a learning path, which actually worked for me: 1️⃣Phase 1: Get your foundation strong Before you jump into the neural nets, make sure your ML basics are clear. You need a solid grasp of: ✔️Programming language: Learn Python, it is the lingua franca of ML. Without understanding Python, you will struggle to implement a basic ML algorithm. 🔎You should know:Syntax and data structuresLoops, Functions, and Object-Oriented ProgrammingNumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, and plotting for computing and manipulating data.Start building a basic movie recommender using Pandas, trust me, it will help later. ✔️Mathematics: Many beginners make the mistake of skipping math and quickly hit a wall. No, you don’t need a math PhD. Just focus on:Linear Algebra- vectors, matrices, operationsCalculus (derivatives, partial derivatives)Probability and Statistics- (mean, variance, distribution, conditionalprobability, hypothesis testing)Learning all these at an intuitive level is fine to build an ML algorithm. 🔎Recommended resources:“Python Crash Course” by Eric Matthes is a bible for beginners“Mathematics for Machine Learning” by Diesenroth, Faisal, and Ong—my go-to reference book.3Blue1Brown’s “Essence of Linear Algebra” series on YouTube—this video will make linear algebra feel like artKhan Academy’s Linear algebra, statistics, and probability basics.2️⃣Phase 2: Learn Data Skills—Data manipulation and Data visualization Fundamentally, machine learning is about extracting data, analyzing insights, and visualizing them. It’s essential to wrangle, clean, analyze, and visualize data. 🔎You should know:Data cleaning techniquesPerforming exploratory data analysisFeature engineering principlesData visualizations and communication.Leave everything aside, go to Kaggle, pick a dataset that excites you, and perform actions like cleaning data, visualizing it, and making predictions. Just build that muscle. Once, I spent 7 hours debugging a model only to realize that my poor data preprocessing was the reason. Learn from my mistake! 3️⃣Phase 3: Learn core ML concepts After the basics, dive deep into the ML universe. Start by understanding what ML is and how it works. Focus on ML techniques and algorithms, including:Supervised Learning: Linear regression, logistic regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and K-NNUnsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN, and Dimensionality ReductionOverfitting, Underfitting, Bias-Variance Tradeoff, accuracy vs precision/recallLearn ML libraries like Scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and TensorFlow.✔️Best courses to learn Machine Learning as a beginner: 🔥Coursera: Machine Learning by Andrew NgThis course was the starting point for my ML journey.It offers a strong theoretical explanation with practical intuition.Andrew Ng intuitively explains overfitting, gradient descent, and optimization, covering all the industry-relevant skills.🔥Fast AI: Introduction to ML for CodersThis course helped me solidify my understanding.Jeremy Howard uses a top-down approach, explaining how ML algorithms actually work.🔥Professional Certificate program in AI and ML by Purdue University and IBM:The course dives deep into advanced AI and ML concepts.It offers comprehensive coverage of data engineering fundamentals that most ML engineers need, but few courses teach.The course offers academic rigor with hands-on projects to prepare learners for ML engineering roles.🔥Logicmojo: Artificial Intelligence courseThis course changes everything for me by allowing me to build working models before diving into theory.I landed my first ML role largely from the projects I built and the knowledge I gained under their expert guidance.The course offers 15+ hands-on AI projects involving technologies like LLMs, Neural networks, Tensorflow, GenAI, and computer vision—this results in 3x more interview call-backs.4️⃣Phase 4: Start working on projects: Working on projects allows you to apply what you have learned and build a portfolio. This was the most important phase of my learning journey ✔️Here are some beginner projects that I started with and always recommend to others:Titanic Survival Prediction (Kaggle) – Binary ClassificationHouse Price Prediction using the Regression ModelFake News Detection – NLP ProjectSentimental analysis on social media using NLP.Customer Segmentation for an E-commerce Site – ClusteringStock Market Prediction Using Time Series AnalysisPublish these projects on GitHub, this will also impress your interviewer. Through these projects, you will be able to showcase the expertise and knowledge you have gained. 🔎Best resources for practice and projects:Kaggle (free real-world datasets to practice)GitHub repositories (projects with examples and open-source projects to contribute to)Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook (tools for building projects)5️⃣Phase 5: Learn deep learning: basics Deep learning and neural networks are increasingly becoming important. 🔎Here are the best courses for further specialization 🔥Fast ai: Practical Deep Learning for CodersThe gold standard for mastering deep learning with some good coding experience.The course emphasized more practical applications, filling the critical gap in my knowledge about productionizing models.These skill sets are in high demand in high-tech companies for maintaining AI systems at scale.🔥Coursera: Deep Learning specialization course by Andrew Ng.Ideal for learners interested in specialization in neural networks and deep learning. Expect to get an in-depth understanding of deep learning, neural networks, CNNs, and RNNs.✔️Common mistakes to avoid: I learned from my journeyEndlessly watching tutorials without practicing anything.Trying to skip the mathematical foundationFocusing too much on libraries and frameworks rather than understanding how algorithm worksWaiting to master everything before building projectsNot connecting with ML communities✍️Final thought: find a learning loop Successful ML engineers are not the ones who are smartest, but the ones who build something, fail a little, learn from it, and repeat I hope this guide helps you in securing your first job role in Machine Learning🚀\n",

If you are aContinue ReadingAs a recent college graduate, the job market can be daunting. The current software engineering field is especially competitive for entry-level roles, with many qualified candidates vying for a limited number of positions. However, there are a few things you can do to improve your chances of getting your first software engineering job out of college. First, and most importantly, highlight and over-emphasize any relevant work experience. If you have any internships, work experience, volunteering, or research assistant work, list it prominently above all other sections on your resume. If you are a sophomore or freshman and planning ahead, the best thing you can do right now is to get summer internships at top-tier companies. If you have completed an internship at a top-tier company and make that loud and clear, you are much more likely to get interviews with much lower effort. If you don’t have official work experience, you must have been doing something during the summers other than playing video games. Figure out how to frame your outside experience projects, or non-software engineering work, as tech-adjacent as possible. Second, try to stand out from the hundreds of other resumes the employer will be reviewing. I remember looking through 150 resumes after a career fair and noticed that every person listed themselves as a “team lead” on the same project in their Operating Systems class. That project was immediately discounted for everyone, which is unfortunate for the person who was actually the lead and got lost in the shuffle. My general advice is to focus on truly unique projects, such as those from a capstone course, hackathon, or class project. This shows you have a lot of curiosity, drive, and creativity. Those projects are also genuinely more interesting to someone reviewing your resume. Finally, don't forget the power of networking. Getting your foot in the door at a company can be just as important as having the right skills and experience. Talk to your friends, family, and professors to see if they know anyone in the software engineering field. Talk to alumni from your school who might be working at companies you are interested in. If you can, try to get a referral or an introduction to someone at the company you want to work. Make sure you explain to the person referring you why you are interested in their specific company. Someone will be more willing to put in an extra good word for you if they see genuine passion and alignment for the company. Interested in Formation? Learn more or apply today.\n",

For large assets logistics, around 9 am is when calls start coming in…FOR EVERYTHING…EVERYTHING from duct tape to specialty requests…air freight, shipping, hot shots, you name it..stuff gets out of control very very fast. Task managers just can’t keep up. The problems are happening in real-time, and we are solving them in human time. They are not the same. You have trucks needing fuel, drivers needing rest, DOT laws, HAZMAT and other clearances, meals, housing (sometimes) taken care of, customs signs off down, tax appeals and forgiveness filed…. all happening simultaneously… Around 12 pm-1pm you decide to take lunch…often on your desk. Did I mention you have probably run to the warehouse about 4 times in just the morning session to make sure the warehouse manager actually HAS what you want. 1pm-5pm you are now picking what to control and what to give up on. You are also taking meetings in between to report to your upper manager who has no idea what is going on (multiple instances), but needs to report to his boss above to actually justify why his job exists to manage you…and thus look like a good manager of people. Anyways…around 5 pm people start going home…you do not…in fact it is at 5 pm when you get back into gear and resolve all the non-emergency/urgent things that you just couldn’t take care of until now…so now you spend time until 8 pm to resolve whatever you had to apologize to delay until the night…and then you setup your next morning’s work so you are on top of your stuff when you walk in. Around 9–11pm is when I would get a chance to get dinner. Usually spend 2 hours checking up with personal stuff and people. Lots of tasks never get completed.

      "标准答案: Fuck all of that. Work life balance is under your full control if you work in a corporate atmosphere (so not like police/teachers/nurse). It has nothing to with the sector you pick, whether that is tech, finance or consulting. When I was 15 and working in a supermarket, I got told off for being late. I made sure that I was always finished before everyone else, they stopped caring and I could come and go whenever I wanted. I was a junior and was told I was not allowed to leave before 5. They didn't believe I had my work finished. Little did they know my work for the following day as well as the fuContinue ReadingFuck all of that. Work life balance is under your full control if you work in a corporate atmosphere (so not like police/teachers/nurse). It has nothing to with the sector you pick, whether that is tech, finance or consulting. When I was 15 and working in a supermarket, I got told off for being late. I made sure that I was always finished before everyone else, they stopped caring and I could come and go whenever I wanted. I was a junior and was told I was not allowed to leave before 5. They didn't believe I had my work finished. Little did they know my work for the following day as well as the full week was finished. They didn't complain anymore. When I was a senior I had to fly out to a client. It was in the morning, I came late because I wanted a coffee break with my boss. It took two hours. The boss of my boss was furious, the client wasn't. They knew we delivered. When the head asked our client if “we delivered” they said they were extremely happy with us and the bullshit stopped. If you worry about work life balance in a corporate firm, you are doing it wrong. I always made sure, wherever I worked, whatever I did, I was far ahead of others. When I lead a team, it was the same. I tell my employees always the same. I don't give a fuck if you want to go to Iceland for a two week holiday, don't book it in the system as holiday, as long as you do all the work you have to do, and are available for calls. People don't understand in this world how much of a boost that is to employees. It gives them wings. They work harder for you than ever before. Micro managers who shit on you for 5 or 10 minutes late. And shout at you, fuck them. Honestly.\n",
      "模型答案: The IT industry and finance field have different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to payments and work-life balance. The IT industry offers higher salaries and better work-life balance, but it is not without its downsides, such as high pressure and politics. The finance industry, on the other hand, offers better work-life balance and a lower entry barrier, but it may not pay as well initially. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preferences and the individual's career goals.\n",

I’m assuming a 5–15 year timespan here. Based on projections from Kurzweil and other futurists AI may reach a human level beyond that point where it’s more capable and more efficient at doing “all jobs”.

Enough jobs to make the unemployment during the great depression look like a walk in the park? yes …this seems likely. I’m assuming a 5–15 year timespan here. Based on projections from Kurzweil and other futurists AI may reach a human level beyond that point where it’s more capable and more efficient at doing “all jobs”. Automation is being made more and more capable by the combination of AI and cheaper sensors. Automation will not take “jobs” it will take tasks. Jobs are dynamic clusters of tasks. Some jobs have lots of explicit tasks, some jobs have more implicit tasks. Tasks that are explicit and repetitive are likely targets for automation. If a job consists of all, or mostly those tasks, it’s likely to be automated away. The more dynamic tasks a job involves the more likely it will remain. Tasks that are less repetitive and less explicit will automate much slower (if at all). Less repetitive might be handyman type jobs within plumbing and electrical. Jobs that are less explicit usually deal with people in complex social interaction or involve creativity that cross-cuts concerns (someone that can do low level ethnographic research of users, then design an efficient/effective product for them, then build it into a product, then market that product…or make all that happen with some help). Some portion of humans will be able to learn fast enough to stay ahead of this AI/Automation wave for a while. We can see that people with a good array of difficult to learn (by most people’s standards) software development skills have regular employment (especially if they’re willing to relocate every 2–3 years). We’ll see incremental changes education. We may see intelligence amplification via devices like Musk’s neuralink. I suspect that these will be enablers for the shrinking portion of people that can stay ahead of the wave. In the 15–20 year timeframe that wave will become a tsunami and jobs will go away.\n",
      "模型答案: AI and automation will have a significant impact on software jobs, with potential consequences including the displacement of many software developer positions and the creation of new opportunities in other fields. While automation and AI can improve the efficiency and accuracy of software development, they may also reduce the need for skilled human coders. Additionally, there will be a need for AI specialists and data scientists to maintain and update the AI systems, which will create new employment opportunities. The implications of these changes on software jobs will depend on the specific nature of the jobs in question.\n",

      "模型答案: To understand the difference between the two, you need to understand the purposes they solve. Computer Vision helps computers to 'see' while NLP helps computers to 'understand'. Computer Vision enables a computer to ‘see’ and understand what it sees. Based on the objects identified by the computer, it takes decisions or provides outputs. Computer Vision is a part of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Google Translate uses Computer Vision to help people navigate in foreign places. Computers are trained on labeled, digital data. They identify patterns in images and ingest information accordingly. Computers depend on different algorithms to extract, identify and understand information from one or many images. Natural Language Processing is also a part of Artificial Intelligence. Computer programs usually require human instructions fed to them in a language they can understand to deliver desired outcomes. Natural Language Processing is the ability of such programs to understand and interpret instructions as fed to them in human language. With Natural Language Processing, computer programs can understand different people in their language of choice like Google Assistant. Google Assistant is, in fact, one of the most famous applications of Natural Language Processing.\n",

      "模型答案: Yes, you need to have a good knowledge of hardware if you want to develop an end to end product. Hardware is the key that is used by engineers to interact with the environment. And in most cases, I noticed that the hardware is the limit in the functionality of a system/product. In most cases, the reason a particular feature cannot be implemented is because the hardware does not support. So to understand the true potential of the product/system you are building you should have a fair idea about the hardware. Not knowing the hardware or getting off the shelf is a shortcut to get a quick product out, but its not long lasting. So I always suggest people to dive deep in hardware datasheets and understand the intrecacies.\n",

If you don’t get a raise, and $$ is really important, start looking for other work. I personally wouldn’t play the counter-offer game. Asking for a raise/promotion, inquiring about career prospects in general, is a good way of making it known that while you have your individual interests in mind (perfectly OK) you are also thinking about your current employer - your expressed plans are couched in terms of your current employer. Whereas mentioning offers from other companies will make your current employer think that your reliability is now in question….rightly or wrongly. Nobody is going to believe that your first contact with recruiters or another company involves a salary discussion; your current employer will believe you are making moves and are having active discussions. So if you pursue the counter-offer game, do it only if you are fully prepared to jump ship.\n",
      "模型答案: As a software developer, you should approach your boss in a professional and respectful manner. If you received an offer from another company, you should discuss it with your current boss and provide them with the details of the new job offer. However, it is important to note that you should not mention the details of the new job offer to your boss unless you are ready to leave your current job and start working at the new company. This will help you maintain a good relationship with your current boss and show your boss that you are committed to your current job and your current company. If you are not ready to leave your current job, you should not mention the details of the new job offer to your boss and should instead focus on discussing the details of the new job offer with your boss. If you need to leave your current job for a new job, you should inform your boss about the details of the new job offer and discuss the terms and conditions of the new job offer with them.

Deposit $5 before moving on because this is one of the biggest mistakes and easiest ones to fix. 2. Overpaying on car insurance: You’ve heard it a million times before, but the average American family still overspends by $417/year on car insurance. If you’ve been with the same insurer for years, chances are you are one of them. Pull up Coverage.com, a free site that will compare prices for you, answer the questions on the page, and it will show you how much you could be saving. That’s it. You’ll likely be saving a bunch of money. Here’s a link to give it a try. 3. Not using a debt relief program: People with $10K in credit card debt can get significant reductions by using a debt relief program. Don’t suffer alone, here’s a quick 2 minute quiz that will tell you if you qualify. 4. Not earning free money while investing: Most people think investing is complicated or for the rich. Not anymore. There are platforms that literally give you free money just to get started. Deposit as little as $25, and you could get up to $1000 in bonus funds. This is the site I recommend to my friends. How to get started Hope this helps! Here are the links to get started: Have a separate savings accountStop overpaying for car insuranceFinally get out of debtStart investing with a free bonus\n",
      "模型答案: There really isn’t an average computer science graduate. I had a job lined up before I graduated. A lot of my friends from college did too. I preferred to work some place else, so after I graduated I spent about three or four months actively searching before I landed a different job. So the answer is it depends. The quality of your experience outside the classroom is what really counts. If you don’t have an internship or a really good side project to put on your resume, you might as well apply for grad school. If you have some experience, a well put together resume, and you can present yourself well in interviews, then you shouldn’t have any trouble finding a job.\n",

Humanoid robotics have long been sci-fi darlings and designer aspirations, but thanks to big data plus emotion and speech recognition, they are becoming the norm. In robotics, and increasingly in formless AI applications like chatbots or virtual agents, developers train software to analyze our every cue -- behavioral and biometric -- to recognize and engage us based on our particular feelings. According to Global Market Insights, the global intelligent virtual assistant market is poised for a 30% compound annual growth rate in the next five years. Conversational, always-personalizing and always-available bots are jumping from smartphones and speakers to toys, headphones, cars, workplaces and beyond. People clutch their smartphones today, but imagine if software agents were children's earliest playmates, forgiving tutors, witty advocates in the search for a job or a date or the go-to for council. A digital companion would have years of individualized data, including every search, step, share, location, handshake, level of stimulation, breath, transaction and thousands of other data points. What happens when humans become so empowered by virtual agents and robotics that they become emotionally, socially or occupationally reliant? People's relationships with machines will shift as AI infuses both consumer products and enterprise decision-making, and as AI itself learns how humans respond, emote and work.\n",

If this is a sincere area of interest for you, I would recommend you begin your additional educational or creative edge on it presently. If you know Unity or Unreal Engine pretty well, and/or can code for it (C++ and Java, the latter mainly for mobile headsets, C#, and/or a handful of others), you are pretty much set. It would not hurt to be savvy with CryEngine or, eventually, Lumberyard. The latter two are mostly a ‘wait-and-see’ attitude, but it will move relatively quick. As a Creative, you should know the Adobe toolset (mainly the video production and post tools, like After Effects, Premiere, Photoshop, etc.). Alternatively, on the super high-end, there are The Foundry tools such as NukeX and CaraVR, ideally also with some knowledge of Mari and/or Modo. If you know Python, then you can write code to help your workflow with The Foundry. If you know any of these tools, then you are armed for any of a number of jobs you will discover on sites such as Oculus, Oculus Story Studio, Pixar, Marvel, Disney, Facebook, HTC, Steam/Valve, Google (DayDream), Xiaomi, et al. Those are some of the biggest, most obvious ones, though plenty of broadcast, commercial studios, and VFX shops are all hopping on to this business. Make no mistake, with $120+ Billion out there, which we can conservatively forecast as being revenue to be generated via hardware, software, and content of all kinds (entertainment, education, medical, enterprise, et al) — everyone is jumping into the fray now.

Computer science spans a broad range of topics. Typical CS undergraduates take courses in algorithms, data structures, hardware and software systems, programing languages, and theory. Embedded systems are computer systems that operate without direct interaction with a human. They range from the engine controller and antilock braking unit in a car to the digital controller for a washing machine or a robotic vacuum cleaner. Compared to conventional programs run on a laptop, desktop, or server, the software for embedded systems has several attributes:It must be highly reliable. A bug in a safety-critical system could have dire consequencesIt must be able to operate autonomously, without a human to restart the system if it fails.It typically process sensor data and often must respond in real time.Historically, the processors for these systems were very limited in terms of their speed, power consumption, memory, and storage. That’s still true today for some systems, but many use high perfomance processors.A generic CS undergraduate degree provides only partial coverage of the topics required to design and implement a reliable embedded system. But, many CS and ECE departments offer courses in embedded systems that cover the range of topics that embedded system designers must understand.\n",
      "模型答案: Computer Systems A computer system is what you think of when someone says the word \"computer.\" The defining feature of a general purpose computer is that it can be reconfigured for a new purpose. In the early days of digital computers, this involved actually rewiring the entire system. Today, most end users aren't even aware that this is happening, as the process has become completely transparent. Embedded Systems An embedded system is a little harder to pin down. It is dedicated to a single purpose, or a small set of purposes. Embedded systems can be found in nearly every single piece of modern electronics--in fact, they are the electronics. A modern television, a portable music player, a computer-controlled air conditioning system or virtually anything made in the last 10 years that isn't a general purpose system and requires electricity: that is what an embedded system is.\n",
