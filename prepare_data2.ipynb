If you want to skip the rant and go to my actual advice, scroll to the bottom! Rant Yes, it’s an obvious advantage that you know some programming. Coding proficiency is a basic requirement to do machine learning, although it’s not as important as in a typical software developer job. Mathematical optimization and calculus is somewhat important. Linear algebra and statistics is really important. Probability and combinatorics is really important. But these are just prerequisites. Most importantly, machine learning is an entire branch of computer science in itself. There is feature engineering, deep learning, ensembling and all kinds of stuff you need to learn about that are not part of the above-mentioned areas. If you come from a regular programming background, machine learning will require a shift in perspective. You’re no longer dealing with deterministic logic in the form of ifs and elses. You’re now dealing with probabilities and uncertainties. In most of software development, the business logic is very simple. In machine learning, business logic is everything. Object-oriented programming is no longer important. Efficient functions are. For loops and while loops are things to be avoided. Matrix multiplications and vectorized code is your new bread and butter. I’m tempted to say that you will need to throw out everything you have learned about programming and start over. That would be an exagerration, but there is some truth in it. Advice With your background, you have a really good foundation for becoming a big data architect. Linux, Python, Java and systems administration is mostly what big data is all about. As a big data developer, you can start experimenting with big data anlytics and gradually progress into machine learning from there.\n",

You can still focus on machine learning, moving forward.Being a Java developer, you know that more than Java per se, you have knowledge of the programming concepts.Classes, objects, project structure, Gui apps etc.Constructs like reading files, parsing huge amount of data, cleansing it, using algorithms etc.These concepts are language agnostic. Language is a tool to implement this.Machine learning is the art of deriving meaning out of data, gaining insights such that we can extrapolate and predict behavior.Here are the high level steps to venture into Machine learning:Agnostic of languages, the concepts of machine learning involve knowing the concepts ofTest dataTraining dataFeature engineeringBinary vs. proficient attributesGaussian distributionsNormalization and a ton of algorithms etc.Understand the theory behind these. Familiarize yourself with the concepts.Once you know the concepts, you need to focus on the tools to exercise your skills.At this point Python and R will be two languages that you will always hear about. So you need to get started on those languages.And they are phenomenal languages for machine learning and data science.They are like power tools to deal with machine learning.Do machine learning problems freely available out there.The internet has a ton of machine learning problems.Exercise and solve them, starting with the simplest of ones and progressing slowly. Use as much help as possible.Take part in machine learning contests and challengesThere are very motivating websites like http://krackle.com etc, that help you motivate in solving machine learning problems. Go for it, and get more and more confident in solving real world problems.Those high level steps should get you started and running. As for not letting go of Java: The thing to remember is that every organization that deals with machine learning projects or systems, has a vast eco-system of surrounding applications. E.g.An e-commerce or insurance company data stream may need utility programs to import data from external sources into your eco-systemFrom here on, machine learning languages can do their things.Again for building dashboards etc. to demonstrate the output of machine learning, orgs may need APIs and websites.ML code will dump insights into a store. And then on top of the store, you could have APIs and web sites to surface them in a friendly manner.For the before and after part of ML systems, you can totally leverage Java.I guess the takeaway is that even though Python and R are the ML languages, a typical organization or company will always need additional expertise possessed by data science employees for these surrounding applications. Bonus. And you maybe in a very good position, where you are good at data science as well as these peripheral applications. So it maybe worth doing Java on the side and not lose touch totally.\n",

These were the 7 most common things I saw when I interviewed at big companies (Facebook, Intel, Square, eBay, etc) for data science related positions. Basic Programming Languages: You should know a statistical programming language, like R or Python (along with Numpy and Pandas Libraries), and a database querying language like SQL Statistics: You should be able to explain phrases like null hypothesis, P-value, maximum likelihood estimators and confidence intervals. Statistics is important to crunch data and to pick out the most important figures out of a huge dataset. This is critical in the decision-making process and to design experiments. Machine Learning: You should be able to explain K-nearest neighbors, random forests, and ensemble methods. These techniques typically are implemented in R or Python. These algorithms show to employers that you have exposure to how data science can be used in more practical manners. Data Wrangling: You should be able to clean up data. This basically means understanding that \"California\" and \"CA\" are the same thing - a negative number cannot exist in a dataset that describes population. It is all about identifying corrupt (or impure) data and and correcting/deleting them. Data Visualization: Data scientist is useless on his or her own. They need to communicate their findings to Product Managers in order to make sure those data are manifesting into real applications. Thus, familiarity with data visualization tools like ggplot is very important (so you can SHOW data, not just talk about them) Software Engineering: You should know algorithms and data structures, as they are often necessary in creating efficient algorithms for machine learning. Know the use cases and run time of these data structures: Queues, Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Trees, etc. Product Management: This one is definitely debatable, but those who understand the product are the ones who will know what metrics are the most important. There are tons of numbers one can A/B test, so product-oriented data scientist will pick the right metrics to experiment with. Know what these terms mean: Usability Testing, Wireframing, Retention and Conversion Rates, Traffic Analysis, Customer Feedback, Internal Logs, A/B Testing. In each field, I mentioned few buzzwords you should know about. There are tons of websites you could use, so I recommend using these 7 branches as a roadmap to guide yourself.

Cross-posting here from How to Ace a Data Science Interview. As I mentioned in my first post, I have just finished an extensive tech job search, which featured eight on-sites, along with countless phone screens and informal chats. I was interviewing for a combination of data science and software engineering (machine learning) positions, and I got a pretty good sense of what those interviews are like. In this post, I give an overview of what you should expect in a data science interview, and some suggestions for how to prepare. An interview is not a pop quiz. You should know what to expect going in, and you can take the time to prepare for it. During the interview phase of the process, your recruiter is on your side and can usually tell you what types of interviews you’ll have. Even if the recruiter is reluctant to share that, common practices in the industry are a good guide to what you’re likely to see. In this post, I’ll go over the types of data science interviews I’ve encountered, and offer my advice on how to prepare for them. Data science roles generally fall into two broad ares of focus: statistics and machine learning. I only applied to the latter category, so that’s the type of position discussed in this post. My experience is also limited to tech companies, so I can’t offer guidance for data science in finance, biotech, etc.. Here are the types of interviews (or parts of interviews) I’ve come across. Always:Coding (usually whiteboard)Applied machine learningYour backgroundOften:Culture fitMachine learning theoryDataset analysisStatsYou will encounter a similar set of interviews for a machine learning software engineering position, though more of the questions will fall in the coding category. Coding (usually whiteboard)This is the same type of interview you’d have for any software engineering position, though the expectations may be less stringent. There are lots of websites and books that will tell you how to prepare. Practice your coding skills if they’re rusty. Don’t forget to practice coding away from the computer (e.g. on paper), which is surely a skill that’s rusty. Review the data structures you may never have used outside of school — binary search trees, linked lists, heaps. Be comfortable with recursion. Know how to reason about algorithm running times. You can generally use any “real” language you want in an interview (Matlab doesn’t count, unfortunately); Python’s succinct syntax makes it a great language for coding interviews. Prep tips:If you get nervous in interviews, try doing some practice problems under time pressure.If you don’t have much software engineering experience, see if you can get a friend to look over your practice code and provide feedback.During the interview:Make sure you understand exactly what problem you’re trying to solve. Ask the interviewer questions if anything is unclear or underspecified.Make sure you explain your plan to the interviewer before you start writing any code, so that they can help you avoid spending time going down less-than-ideal paths.If you can’t think of a good way to do something, it often helps to start by talking through a dumb way to do it.Mention what invalid inputs you’d want to check for (e.g. input variable type check). Don’t bother writing the code to do so unless the interviewer asks. In all my interviews, nobody has ever asked.Before declaring that your code is finished, think about variable initialization, end conditions, and boundary cases (e.g. empty inputs). If it seems helpful, run through an example. You’ll score points by catching your bugs yourself, rather than having the interviewer point them out.Applied machine learningAll the applied machine learning interviews I’ve had focused on supervised learning. The interviewer will present you with a prediction problem, and ask you to explain how you would set up an algorithm to make that prediction. The problem selected is often relevant to the company you’re interviewing at (e.g. figuring out which product to recommend to a user, which users are going to stop using the site, which ad to display, etc.), but can also be a toy example (e.g. recommending board games to a friend). This type of interview doesn’t depend on much background knowledge, other than having a general understanding of machine learning concepts (see below). However, it definitely helps to prepare by brainstorming the types of problems a particular company might ask you to solve. Even if you miss the mark, the brainstorming session will help with the culture fit interview (also see below). When answering this type of question, I’ve found it helpful to start by laying out the setup of the problem. What are the inputs? What are the labels you’re trying to predict? What machine learning algorithms could you run on the data? Sometimes the setup will be obvious from the question, but sometimes you’ll need to figure out how to define the problem. In the latter case, you’ll generally have a discussion with the interviewer about some plausible definitions (e.g., what does it mean for a user to “stop using the site”?). The main component of your answer will be feature engineering. There is nothing magical about brainstorming features. Think about what might be predictive of the variable you are trying to predict, and what information you would actually have available. I’ve found it helpful to give context around what I’m trying to capture, and to what extent the features I’m proposing reflect that information. For the sake of concreteness, here’s an example. Suppose Amazon is trying to figure out what books to recommend to you. (Note: I did not interview at Amazon, and have no idea what they actually ask in their interviews.) To predict what books you’re likely to buy, Amazon can look for books that are similar to your past Amazon purchases. But maybe some purchases were mistakes, and you vowed to never buy a book like that again. Well, Amazon knows how you’ve interacted with your Kindle books. If there’s a book you started but never finished, it might be a positive signal for general areas you’re interested in, but a negative signal for the particular author. Or maybe some categories of books deserve different treatment. For example, if a year ago you were buying books targeted at one-year-olds, Amazon could deduce that nowadays you’re looking for books for two-year-olds. It’s easy to see how you can spend a while exploring the space between what you’d like to know and what you can actually find out. Your backgroundYou should be prepared to give a high-level summary of your career, as well as to do a deep-dive into a project you’ve worked on. The project doesn’t have to be directly related to the position you’re interviewing for (though it can’t hurt), but it needs to be the kind of work you can have an in-depth technical discussion about. To prepare:Review any papers/presentations that came out of your projects to refresh your mind on the technical details.Practice explaining your project to a friend in order to make sure you are telling a coherent story. Keep in mind that you’ll probably be talking to someone who’s smart but doesn’t have expertise in your particular field.Be prepared to answer questions as to why you chose the approach that you did, and about your individual contribution to the project.Culture fitHere are some culture fit questions your interviewers are likely to be interested in. These questions might come up as part of other interviews, and will likely be asked indirectly. It helps to keep what the interviewer is looking for in the back of your mind.Are you specifically interested in the product/company/space you’d be working in?It helps to prepare by thinking about the problems the company is trying to solve, and how you and the team you’d be part of could make a difference.Do you care about impact? Even in a research-oriented corporate environment, I wouldn’t recommend saying that you don’t care about company metrics, and that you’d love to just play with data and write papers.Will you work well with other people? I know it’s a cliché, but most work is collaborative, and companies are trying to assess this as best they can. Avoid bad-mouthing former colleagues, and show appreciation for their contributions to your projects.Are you willing to get your hands dirty? If there’s annoying work that needs to be done (e.g. cleaning up messy data), will you take care of it?Are you someone the team will be happy to have around on a personal level? Even though you might be stressed, try to be friendly, positive, enthusiastic and genuine throughout the interview process.You may also get broad questions about what kinds of work you enjoy and what motivates you. It’s useful to have an answer ready, but there may not be a “right” answer the interviewer is looking for. Machine learning theoryThis type of interview will test your understanding of basic machine learning concepts, generally with a focus on supervised learning. You should understand:The general setup for a supervised learning systemWhy you want to split data into training and test setsThe idea that models that aren’t powerful enough can’t capture the right generalizations about the data, and ways to address this (e.g. different model or projection into a higher-dimensional space)The idea that models that are too powerful suffer from overfitting, and ways to address this (e.g. regularization)You don’t need to know a lot of machine learning algorithms, but you definitely need to understand logistic regression, which seems to be what most companies are using. I also had some in-depth discussions of SVMs, but that may just be because I brought them up. Dataset analysisIn this type of interview, you will be given a data set, and asked to write a script to pull out features for some prediction task. You may be asked to then plug the features into a machine learning algorithm. This interview essentially adds an implementation component to the applied machine learning interview (see above). Of course, your features may now be inspired by what you see in the data. Do the distributions for each feature you’re considering differ between the labels you’re trying to predict? I found these interviews hardest to prepare for, because the recruiter often wouldn’t tell me what format the data would be in, and what exactly I’d need to do with it. (For example, do I need to review Python’s csv import module? Should I look over the syntax for training a model in scikit-learn?) I also had one recruiter tell me I’d be analyzing “big data”, which was a bit intimidating (am I going to be working with distributed databases or something?) until I discovered at the interview that the “big data” set had all of 11,000 examples. I encourage you to push for as much info as possible about what you’ll actually be doing. If you plan to use Python, working through the scikit-learn tutorial is a good way to prepare. StatsI have a decent intuitive understanding of statistics, but very little formal knowledge. Most of the time, this sufficed, though I’m sure knowing more wouldn’t have hurt. You should understand how to set up an A/B test, including random sampling, confounding variables, summary statistics (e.g. mean), and measuring statistical significance.

Convert your worries to actions- Improve your coding skills with practice. You should be positive about your future. No matter what. You will get what you want. First Have the patience to read my long post :-) It is only my way of looking at things. Please ignore if something hurts you. Many of us look for easy ways(short cuts/tips) to crack any type of interviews like going through previous Interview questions etc... Right from fresher to Project Manager level are looking for these jobs. The answer to this question is different for different people. Ask yourself the following questions: Are you a fresher, or experienced, If experienced(other than data science), how many years: less than 5, 5-10, or more than 10. Here I consider (0-3 years) as Fresher Bin1: because they are in the early stage of Career. (3 -10) years as Bin2. Above 10 years as another Bin3. Fresher(Bin1) : We know what to do but we look for others to guide us. Just I am reminding you what you have forgotten. Before appearing for an interview You should be good at following things. 1. Machine learning fundamentals. 2. Python programming 3. Good presentation skills You already know this Right. How to get these. First and foremost thing: Are you trying on your own or under some guidance like taking the course offline or online? Because you should have solid Machine learning concepts or material with you. If you do not have this, prepare your material first. Of course, you should be good at coding as well. Assuming you know data preprocessing. How to prepare your material 1. List down the Machine learning Algorithms you are familiar with. 2. Browse the blogs, books, videos, get the intuition of each algorithm how it works. Write a few lines( not more than 50 words) about the algorithm in simple terms I repeat layman terms. Look into the Maths part when it is needed only. 3. Get hold of the Algorithm even with numerical examples wherever it is possible For example in K-nearest neighbor Given data points(instances) with target how to do you decide the target of the test data point. Here we do simple distance calculation and we take mode based on k value. Likewise for other algorithms how to choose root node(decision trees), Clustering (Computing Centroid and forming clusters), Naive Bayes(Bayers theorem), and so on wherever it is possible. 4. Prepare sample code snippets for each algorithm in python. 5. Explain to your friends in very simple terms, so that they can understand. Likewise, all the major concepts like bias-variance, overfitting-underfitting, cross-validation, splitting data into train data, and test data, whichever concept you read to give your best. Do not forget the statistics. Now comes to Interview, Give simple terms. Explain the concept in simple terms and say the concept name. ( Strictly no shortcut answers) What is overfitting: People talk about bias-variance trade-off though they are not clear about that. Is there any other way to answer this. Think in terms of the error in train data and test data. (If you are clear with this and confident that you can convince the interviewer you can opt this, but do not get into unnecessary trouble by speaking terms which you don't know) Know what you speak. No shortcut answers Eg; What is Principal Component Analysis? Many of us give a one-line answer It is a dimensionality reduction technique. which is not recommended. What if you explain in the following way. Start with data: In some domains, there is a problem either classification or regression. Now when there are more attributes/dimensions/columns in the data, If we want to see a quick look at the results. I opt for a less no. of dimensions as much as possible. I can find it by finding orthogonal components where each component is a linear combination of the other components. These are called eigenvectors which we find through eigenvalues from Covariance Matrix by solving equation (A-lamda) * x=0. I select only the top few components which explain more variance in the data through the scree plot. (Though we are not going into mathematics you should have this in your mind). If at all interviewer asks the next question to solve the equation you should be ready to do it. The Disadvantage of this is we can't explain it to the business as each component is a linear combination. The advantage is sometimes linear combination will make sense; Eg: predict the score of a dish where attributes are ingredients. Now component becomes a linear combination of ingredients and etc.. You should answer every question with confidence. This comes through practice. In parallel to the above, you should have basic python programming skills as well. Solve python exercises from different websites, need not be from data science. Type python programming exercises in Google take top10 websites. Get your hands dirty in Pandas, NumPy, various operations on data, preprocessing data, Take several datasets to build multiple algorithms without copying code from the Internet. Improve debugging skills. Change the approach to Learning by debugging from Learning by Coding once you are comfortable with coding. If you do everything as specified, It will boost your confidence. This helps you to crack the interview. Further, have some idea on what is going on in data science; Get some basic concepts in Text mining and deep learning if you are a beginner. You can apply the same method even in these areas as well. Bin2: By doing above all how do you use your current job experience. Get the domain knowledge; Try to link data science problems to your domain, From a fresher, we can expect technical. But from experienced think like if you want to take a person into your project What you expect from him. As you are experienced start exploring git, version control tools, how can you use your previous experience into DataScience? It is just like you are moving to new technology. Use your commonsense and experience, Show your experience in thoughts and talks. You are not a kid anymore. Bin3: Not much to say; They should think, In What way we can add value to the existing system through data science. Stop depending on the others, You are an experienced person as a Manager, Team Lead, Module Lead, Tech Manager etc.. You know how the system works. No need to reinvent the wheel. Convert the industry problems to data science problems and get into the research. Saying is easy I know. But It is reality. You should accept it and move on. How can you help the company with your thoughts and work? You are the guide to yourself and your team. Update 2nd September: Go through the very basics of SQL. Having some knowledge in SQL is a plus. What is SQL?SQL Retrieve data from tables [33 Exercises]SQL Aggregate Functions [25 Exercises]SQL JOINSSQL JOINS [29 Exercises]As I said earlier every one knew this just I am reminding you. All the best. I hope It is informative though it is long. Remember one Mantra: Patience, Practice, Stay Positive….. Thanks, Shiva Prasad Koyyada, INSOFE.\n",
