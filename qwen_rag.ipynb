If you want to skip the rant and go to my actual advice, scroll to the bottom! Rant Yes, it’s an obvious advantage that you know some programming. Coding proficiency is a basic requirement to do machine learning, although it’s not as important as in a typical software developer job. Mathematical optimization and calculus is somewhat important. Linear algebra and statistics is really important. Probability and combinatorics is really important. But these are just prerequisites. Most importantly, machine learning is an entire branch of computer science in itself. There is feature engineering, deep learning, ensembling and all kinds of stuff you need to learn about that are not part of the above-mentioned areas. If you come from a regular programming background, machine learning will require a shift in perspective. You’re no longer dealing with deterministic logic in the form of ifs and elses. You’re now dealing with probabilities and uncertainties. In most of software development, the business logic is very simple. In machine learning, business logic is everything. Object-oriented programming is no longer important. Efficient functions are. For loops and while loops are things to be avoided. Matrix multiplications and vectorized code is your new bread and butter. I’m tempted to say that you will need to throw out everything you have learned about programming and start over. That would be an exagerration, but there is some truth in it. Advice With your background, you have a really good foundation for becoming a big data architect. Linux, Python, Java and systems administration is mostly what big data is all about. As a big data developer, you can start experimenting with big data anlytics and gradually progress into machine learning from there.\n",

Here are the biggest mistakes people are making and how to fix them: 1. Not having a separate high interest savings account: Having a separate account allows you to see the results of all your hard work and keep your money separate so you're less tempted to spend it. Plus with rates above 5.00%, the interest you can earn compared to most banks really adds up. Here is a list of the top savings accounts available today. Deposit $5 before moving on because this is one of the biggest mistakes and easiest ones to fix. 2. Overpaying on car insurance: You’ve heard it a million times before, but the average American family still overspends by $417/year on car insurance. If you’ve been with the same insurer for years, chances are you are one of them. Pull up Coverage.com, a free site that will compare prices for you, answer the questions on the page, and it will show you how much you could be saving. That’s it. You’ll likely be saving a bunch of money. Here’s a link to give it a try. 3. Not using a debt relief program: People with $10K in credit card debt can get significant reductions by using a debt relief program. Don’t suffer alone, here’s a quick 2 minute quiz that will tell you if you qualify. 4. Not earning free money while investing: Most people think investing is complicated or for the rich. Not anymore. There are platforms that literally give you free money just to get started. Deposit as little as $25, and you could get up to $1000 in bonus funds. This is the site I recommend to my friends. How to get started Hope this helps! Here are the links to get started: Have a separate savings accountStop overpaying for car insuranceFinally get out of debtStart investing with a free bonus\n",

      "问题: Is making more money the primary reason for job hopping as a software engineer?\n",
      "标准答案: The computer industry has been un-usual in that every year you work your value as a employee exceeds the amount you can expect to get as raise. A raise is a percentage based on your wage. If you work at a job for several years your value on the job market will exceed what you make by a healthy chunk. Keep in mind your employer is paying for your experience and knowledge. Also if you are not learning anything new it is probably time to switch.\n",
      "模型答案: Making more money is not the primary reason for job hopping as a software engineer. While it can be a significant factor, it is not the sole motivation. Job hopping is a personal decision that reflects an individual's career aspirations and priorities. It is more about the growth and development of skills, gaining new experiences, and making a positive impact on the work environment. The software engineer's main focus should be on improving their professional skills and contributing to the company's growth.\n",

      "标准答案: So, you have an offer from another company, but you still want to negotiate with your current company, because you might stay? And they’ve asked how much the other company is offering? You can say anything that you want “They offered me a zillion skillion dollars”. If money is the only reason to leave or to stay, you should tell your current company what it will take, salary-wise, to make you stay. Then you should look for a job that pays more money, since your current company knows that you’re willing to leave for more money\n",
      "模型答案: No, it is not rude to ask for a written contract before accepting a job offer. In fact, it is considered a prudent and professional step. A written contract provides clarity on the terms of employment, including salary, benefits, job responsibilities, and other important details. It's in both your and the employer's best interest to have a clear understanding of the agreement. Just approach the request politely, expressing that you want to ensure you fully understand the terms before making a commitment.\n",

Your grooming matters. The money you make will make you feel very rich. But you need to keep living small. Student loans need to be paid back. If you can stay with roommates in a house. Save a ton of money. Work is not a course or term paper. You do not get a new start in 18 weeks and you do not get to turn in your work, have your professor tell you what you did wrong, and try it again.

I bet you can knock out at least three or four of these right now—yes, even from your phone. Don’t wait like I did. 1. Cancel Your Car Insurance You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix. Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called Insurify shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year. If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you. Tired of overpaying for car insurance?

Ask This Company to Get a Big Chunk of Your Debt Forgiven A company called National Debt Relief could convince your lenders to simply get rid of a big chunk of what you owe. No bankruptcy, no loans — you don’t even need to have good credit. If you owe at least $10,000 in unsecured debt (credit card debt, personal loans, medical bills, etc.), National Debt Relief’s experts will build you a monthly payment plan. As your payments add up, they negotiate with your creditors to reduce the amount you owe. You then pay off the rest in a lump sum. On average, you could become debt-free within 24 to 48 months. It takes less than a minute to sign up and see how much debt you could get rid of. 3. You Can Become a Real Estate Investor for as Little as $10 Take a look at some of the world’s wealthiest people. What do they have in common? Many invest in large private real estate deals. And here’s the thing: There’s no reason you can’t, too — for as little as $10. An investment called the Fundrise Flagship Fund lets you get started in the world of real estate by giving you access to a low-cost, diversified portfolio of private real estate. The best part? You don’t have to be the landlord. The Flagship Fund does all the heavy lifting. With an initial investment as low as $10, your money will be invested in the Fund, which already owns more than $1 billion worth of real estate around the country, from apartment complexes to the thriving housing rental market to larger last-mile e-commerce logistics centers. Want to invest more? Many investors choose to invest $1,000 or more. This is a Fund that can fit any type of investor’s needs. Once invested, you can track your performance from your phone and watch as properties are acquired, improved, and operated. As properties generate cash flow, you could earn money through quarterly dividend payments. And over time, you could earn money off the potential appreciation of the properties. So if you want to get started in the world of real-estate investing, it takes just a few minutes to sign up and create an account with the Fundrise Flagship Fund. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Real Estate Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund’s prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. 4. Get Up to $50,000 From This Company Need a little extra cash to pay off credit card debt, remodel your house or to buy a big purchase?

      "问题: Is technical interview question from a company easier than its coding challenge?\n",
      "标准答案: It depends on the company. More importantly, it depends on your strengths and preferences as a candidate. Do you prefer a take-home, open-book test or an in-class, closed-book test? A coding challenge is usually a take-home assignment. You get to work in your own home, with your own development environment, access to online resources, and with loose time constraints. But you’re likely to spend at least several hours on the coding challenge A technical interview occurs under tight time constraints, either on-site or remotely over a videoconference.

Do you prefer a take-home, open-book test or an in-class, closed-book test? A coding challenge is usually a take-home assignment. You get to work in your own home, with your own development environment, access to online resources, and with loose time constraints. But you’re likely to spend at least several hours on the coding challenge A technical interview occurs under tight time constraints, either on-site or remotely over a videoconference. An individual interview is unlikely to last more than an hour — though you might have several in a row as part of a full-day, on-site interview. A technical interview typically a mix of talking about your past work, interactive problem solving, and coding. But you usually write code in a environment you’d never use for real development, e.g., CoderPad or a whiteboard. Which is easier? It really depends. If you do well under pressure, then an onsite interview may require less work, and you’re unlikely to have to go into much depth. On the other hand, you may prefer a take-home coding challenge as an opportunity to do more work at your own pace. As a hiring manager, I’d say that the coding challenge is probably a more accurate way to assess a candidate’s coding ability than a technical interview. But it also requires significantly more time investment on the part of the candidate, which introduces the risk of biasing the candidate pool towards people who have more time or lack other compelling opportunities. When possible, I’ve offered candidates the opportunity to demonstrate their coding ability in a variety of ways, letting them pick one that plays to their strengths and preferences — as long as it provides the signal I need to assess them.\n",

But i need a teacher who can work hard on me and then I got to know about Deepak sir from my husband working in PNB he cleared his FRM under his guidance. My Husband was very weak in quants but now he is so confident you can ask him anything. Deepak sir nurture the students from very basics. He also provide technical knowledge like Python and Data Science. He is really good if you want a personal mentor then go with him. Or if you want just video then go with YouTube. Lectures are very well designed for working professional and easy to understand. Weekly test make course easier to pass the exam. One to one doubt solving and personalised attention with proper planning and scheduling is like a blessing. Best part is that you can ring him anytime of the day. You can check one video of one of our batchmate passed CFA exam in 50 days time. Testimony is given by her father himself. People at that age don't give false testimony. So you can trust this review and video. Hopefully i will get same meeting with Deepak sir soon.\n",

      "模型答案: Yes, job hopping is looked down upon as a software engineer. It shows that you are not loyal to your current employer, and that you are seeking a more lucrative opportunity. This is seen as a negative trait in many companies, as they view job hopping as a lack of commitment and loyalty. However, it is important to note that this perception may not be accurate, as some companies may not consider job hopping a bad thing, as long as it is done in a professional and ethical manner. Ultimately, the decision to job hop is a personal one, and it is up to the individual to decide if it is the right choice for their career.\n",

I doubt they will ask you any questions about markets that will be make or break type of questions, but it is always good to show a real interest in the areas they trade.

With all the new-age scams out there, it really matters to know these mistakes - so pay attention! Here’s the Most Common Mistakes: Hiring a “Financial Advisor” who is not a Fiduciary Anybody can be a “financial advisor”. It’s an unregulated term so the title means nothing. Not going to name names, but plenty of companies out there abuse this term. Just watch “The Wolf Of Wall Street” to see more on how that works! On the other hand, there’s a key type of financial advisor called a “Fidicuary” and they are what you want. They are legally obligated to make financial decisions that are in your best interest. They are the good guys on your side, and they can even lose their license if they do anything deemed unethical by regulators. You can find fiduciaries near you on websites like ComparisonAdviser.com - their network is exclusively vetted and regulated fiduciaries. Hiring the first advisor you meet Ideally you are looking for a long-term partner in this space. It’s best to interview more than one advisor before making your final decision. Do what feels right for you. Not checking their credentials This goes without saying…make sure the advisor has the credentials and licenses to handle your finances. It never hurts to ask about tests they have taken as well! As I mentioned above, the highest-standard are called fiduciaries so you can expect them to have all their ducks in a row. Not hiring a specialist that meets your specific needs After the basics of getting a vetted fiduciary, from there you want to consider specialties. Do not get a “generalist”. Find someone with experience for your exact situation. Some key areas that you want your fiduciary to be extremely versed in:They are familiar with your state laws and taxes.They are specialists in the GOAL you are trying to achieve (investing/retirement/business/etc.)They are specialists with the asset types you have (401k/IRA/real estate/stock/etc.)They are familiar with the SIZE and of assets you have.

      "模型答案: I might not be qualified to answer this as I am still in school, but I am a rising senior currently studying both Finance and Computer Science as a double major at a decent school. I'm going to assume you want to be a quant since that is probably the software job that really uses both Financial and CS knowledge. However what I've learned, you've done it the wrong way around. My father's friend works as a quant and he said that it does not matter at all whether you have Finance knowledge whatsoever. What matters is your programming/maths knowledge. Everything Finance you can pick up on the way. Being a quant or some other kind of software engineer at a Finance company is about your technical skills, not your Finance knowledge. And the people who apply to these jobs are the best of the best due to the compensation. I'm not trying to dissuade you from trying if this is truly your goal. But I don't think there's a real boot camp to get you to the level of a true software engineer. I know there are a lot of stories of startup founders who learned how to build a website online and became successful but a degree in CS is as difficult as a degree in the hard sciences. So imagine trying to boot camp your way into being\n",

      "标准答案: As a product manager I learned that it is not possible to do everything yourself. You need to rely on others. But most importantly, you need to learn how to delegate, or you will find yourself doing all the work or worse, assigning tasks to people that do not have the necessary skills.I had a team of four people that helped me with various tasks regarding production processes.

You need to rely on others. But most importantly, you need to learn how to delegate, or you will find yourself doing all the work or worse, assigning tasks to people that do not have the necessary skills.I had a team of four people that helped me with various tasks regarding production processes. At least that is how it was supposed to be. When I started this position, I found myself swamped with work every day. Everybody would leave the office at 5pm sharp and I was the only one staying until eight. The next day was a rinse and repeat from the previous one. I was having problems understanding why this situation kept happening. I was feeling burnt out by the end of my first month. I seriously considered quitting. One day, a member of my team came into my office to drop some documents, telling me that this was what I requested. I looked at her because I remembered telling her I needed a copy of it, then the original had to be archived again. She left my office and I stayed there, just holding the documents in my hand. Then it dawned on me. I was doing all the work, I was so worried about the quality of the work that I had decided, unconsciously, that I needed to do it to make certain that it had no errors (I know that is not possible, but my insecurities had taken a hold of me) that could get me into trouble. That night, I went into my old college notes on management and found that part about delegating tasks. It is important to take advantage of the strengths of your team, you should know their strengths and weaknesses, you should map out the skills and abilities of each member so you know you can trust someone with part of the job because you know they will come through. So, let me tell you the five changes I made in my management style that allowed me to learn that skill of delegating work effectively, as a product manager. 1. Map out all processes that happen in your department It is important to have a visual tool to check out all the processes that your department has, as well as those that your department is a part of. You need to have a big picture idea of what is going on in your area, even if it is small. Then, you need to document that. But I think it is more useful to involve your team in this exercise, they know all the processes and those little details of what needs to happen to deliver on time and within budget. Make someone responsible for mapping out all the processes, with the help of the rest of the team, and ask that person to document all processes. Then, you can sit down and discuss areas of opportunity. 2. Talk to each member of your team and ask them what they do daily This is very important, especially if you are the new boss. This conversation may help them navigate the uncertainty of new management, it will put them at ease. Don’t make this into a review meeting, ask questions about processes, not about their performance. This meeting will help you assess what their experiences are, what they know about their part of the job, and how they can help you achieve your goals. You need to document what they tell you so you can build that big picture. At the end, sit down on your own and start analyzing the data. Here you can find what each member of your team can do for you, how they can help, their strengths and their weaknesses. 3. Try to find a second in command If you bring somebody with you to help you (I didn’t, I had to find one), they can be your second in command. Otherwise, find one within your new team. Of course, trust will take some time to develop but work with them towards building a way of working where you can delegate managerial tasks that you don’t need to do. This person will help you with the ideas you want to implement, they should work with you in tuning up the process to achieve your goals. If you find that person objecting to a lot of your ideas, then you may need to find somebody else. 4. Divide the tasks among the team Once the processes are documented, divide the tasks among your team, considering their strengths and weaknesses. If you have an expert on metallurgy, don’t place that person in charge of desk tasks, that person should be on the floor or in the testing labs. This is just an example, but keep in mind that this division must be comparable to their position level, meaning that you can’t assign managerial tasks to the guy in charge of making the copies. You need to be fair. But you also need to give room for improvement, if somebody is having problems, evaluate the best strategy to switch tasks and give that person some other tasks they can perform. The reason that lady handed me that original report is that I did not specify clearly what I needed, you need to be as specific as possible but give them some room for autonomy, you need to empower them. 5. Don’t micromanage So, this is what I was doing when I began as a product manager for a manufacturing company, like I mentioned before. You can supervise but you don’t need to make daily rounds to check if they are doing the job. This is the reason you need to set delivery times. You need them to commit to their deliveries. When you do the division of tasks, you also need to establish the deliveries. If you ask somebody to do something for you, specify exactly the goal and how long you expect this to be completed. Your second in command must be the one doing the rounds, checking that everybody is on task. You need to trust that all of them will get on board with your project. You will see those who don’t agree, and you can replace them, if that is the case. Finally, I would like to establish that this was a very long process, and it was not easy. I learned a lot during this experience, and I am grateful I had the opportunity to work with that team. When I left, the operation was running smoothly, we were on time and did not have to expand our budget. In terms of personal relations, even though I treated all my workers with the uttermost respect, I was not sure if they liked me. But, at the end, they threw a goodbye party for me, which I was not expecting. That is how I realized I had made an impact on this team. So, the best skill you can learn as a product manager is to delegate responsibilities and tasks to the right people. Make goals and deliverables clear, make them commit to these, taking into account their strengths and weaknesses. In this latter, maybe you can offer to help them overcome this through training or mentoring. But don’t think you can do everything on your own, that is, as I learned, rather silly.\n",

      "标准答案: I decided to pursue the IC (Individual Contributor) path. It is a lonely path. Nearly all my peers my age have long transitioned into engineering management. As such, I think I have a good handle on why so many leave IC to become managers. There are a variety of reasons.It is harder to become a very senior IC than an EM. As ICs advance in rank, they are not only expected to contribute company-wide impact, they are also expected to contribute industry-wide impact. It is difficult to achieve this without being a honest-to-goodness expert in one or more fields. Achieving this requires a tremendouContinue ReadingI decided to pursue the IC (Individual Contributor) path. It is a lonely path. Nearly all my peers my age have long transitioned into engineering management. As such, I think I have a good handle on why so many leave IC to become managers. There are a variety of reasons.It is harder to become a very senior IC than an EM. As ICs advance in rank, they are not only expected to contribute company-wide impact, they are also expected to contribute industry-wide impact. It is difficult to achieve this without being a honest-to-goodness expert in one or more fields. Achieving this requires a tremendous amount of self-study and passion for the subject matter.Scaling influence gets more difficult. Suppose you have achieved (1) and are now a world-class expert in some field. Your company is starting a project in your field that will span many teams. You can easily come up a design that will work on Day 1 and scales out to a billion users. But… although that’s the part that leverages expertise, it is not the hard part. How do you convince people that your design is right? For one thing, guarantee, there will be somebody or somebodies who can make the same promises with 1/4 the headcount. Scaling influence requires communication savvy and political skills… which also just happens to lean into the traits that make up good EMs.Companies don’t support the IC path. In theory, many top-notch companies now have abandoned the Peter Principle and now consider the technical IC track to be fully parallel and equivalent to the managerial track. In reality, even in companies where this track receives good support, people internally tend to discriminate against ICs for a variety of reasons which makes it difficult to exert influence.People don’t know what they don’t know. This is somewhat related to #2. One example of this happening: at a prior company I worked in, I designed an ad tracking system that would scale out and required only 15 or so HTTP servers with geographical redundancy and spiky load support. I knew my math was right. However, when I put the homebrew HTTP server on top of it, the HTTP rate was limited to 100–400 QPS. I was shocked. I did some investigation and TL;DR - found the company was wasting upward of 75MM an year with this unsalable HTTP library where there were some fleets of 500 servers accepting only 7 requests a second on average — somehow nobody ever questioned this. I raised the alarm, and got pushback from networking engineers (in the form of “your numbers are wrong, we support up to 800 requests a second”). But I stood my ground, proved that 20K or so HTTP requests a second is a much better target to achieve, and we rolled out the original design with 15 HTTP servers on a rewritten library. The point being - there are many engineers who have a certain kind of hubris that makes it difficult for them to accept that they are not yet experts, and it’s hard for an aspiring IC to succeed in this kind of environment without having skin a foot thick.There are more reasons, but I’d list all of these the most important reasons for why I stay awake at 3 AM wondering why I didn’t go down management. But ultimately, knowledge is my passion, and the IC path allows me to pursue that more freely.\n",

The outcome of one interview will not make or break your life. Always remember that. Each ‘failure’ is an opportunity. Of course, if you keep ‘failing’ without improving, you’re wasting time.

Maximize each interview by taking notes, reviewing, researching, and improving your answers for the next time. This both turns it into a learning experience, and takes some of the pressure off of the interview. Fear of judgment is a little harder. The interview is an assessment. There’s no sugar-coating that reality. But, it’s an assessment on both sides. Shoulder some of the responsibility of that assessment by thinking of you and the interviewer as partners in deciding whether it’s a good fit. This can really help in reframing the interview in your own mind, and eliminating some of that nervousness. The outcome, decided by either you or the interviewer, may be that it’s not a good fit. There are really only two interpretations of this (that matter): you’re better off in a different company or role, or, you’re not ready yet and so you learn, grow, and get ready for the next time.\n",
      "模型答案: Try to shade anxiety with some other emotions. For me personally two of them work: Boredom - you’ve been through so many interviews recently that you are just too tired to be nervous. It just another one in the row, almost same questions, just different people. Taking a couple of “practice” interviews with the companies you don’t want to work for (that much) helps. Fun - do you enjoy your job and IT in general? It is hard work, but it is still fun. Many developers can’t go to sleep till they finished coding a feature just because they like it that way. Interviews can be fun too - meet some interesting people, discuss tech. Having a positive attitude helps shift formal interview (which is like a competition of sort - you’re struggling to get past the interviewer) to a discussion where everyone just talks about their IT experience. This worked for me multiple times - interviewers told me about architecture of their system, I’ve told them some related stories from my experience and in the end it didn’t matter if they would make an offer or not - the interview was fun for everybody (but usually they did make the offer :).\n",

I also worked on scalable systems as a software engineer for 8+ years. System Design has become a standard technical interview topic at most tech companies. That means the sooner you start to develop a working knowledge of System Design, the better. At face value, a big challenge to the System Design interview is that most interviewees don't have experience building large-scale systems. As a new grad, you are probably feeling this pressure. But here is the thing to remember: most interviewers aren't looking for applied System Design experience. Rather, they are looking for a working knowledge of modern System Design fundamentals. I wrote a blog called How to prepare for the system design interview, which is a good place to start. In this article, I cover:Distributed system fundamentalsArchitecture of large-scale web applicationsDesigning distributed systemsThe only way to succeed in the SDI is by internalizing System Design fundamentals. It’s not as simple as just drilling practice questions (as an interviewer I can always tell when a candidate took this approach). What I really want is to understand your thought process when I ask you how to design a complex, large-scale system. You should outline the requirements, scope, and constraints before suggesting a solution. Then be prepared to have a discussion about which tradeoffs you need to make, and why. Again, in order to do all of this fluently, you need to familiarize yourself with the building blocks of modern System Design. If you are ready to go in-depth, I highly recommend the recent course from the team at Educative: Grokking Modern System Design for Engineers and Managers. It provides comprehensive coverage of modern System Design, from the fundamentals to their use in real-world applications. It teaches best practices and design principles of large-scale distributed systems that have revolutionized our modern software landscape and stood the test of time.﻿ A lot of work and validation went into creating this course, in order to make it the best and most up-to-date resource it can possibly be. I hope you find it useful. Good luck and happy learning!\n",
      "模型答案: For the most part, I’d say that there aren’t high expectations for new grads to perform well on system design interviews. You’re right that, usually, you would end up needing some experience with material on the job. And because of that, I think most places don’t end up asking system design interviews to new grads. The exceptions I’ve found for this are Confluent and Uber. If you want to review material, then I’d say that the content on donnemartin/system-design-primer is pretty good as an overview. And for more depth to go over on the longer term, I thought that the book Designing Data-Intensive Applications was pretty solid.\n",

WTF is that? But, as most adults know, they were right, just incomplete. The full answer should’ve been something like,Don’t have the goal of having just somebody, but rather invest in yourself. Be okay with yourself, who you are, what you love, and don’t compromise that for anything. Then go out and meet tons of people with the goal of finding out if they compliment who you are.WTF does this have to do with engineering!? Right! A point to all this wordiness, I almost forgot. Well, it’s exactly the same thing. When people go into software engineering and try to have a checklist that says “own project, implement unit tests, contribute to architectural piece, collaborate on cross-team project, then I will be SDE2, huzzah!” It actually doesn’t work. Worse still, when that fails to work, it destroys morale. No option to work cross-team, maybe you did do all those things, but you’re still not technically up to par. Maybe you’re a super badass coder, but you suck at giving/taking feedback, who knows. Start with yourself, and don’t even try to get promoted. This is where it ties back together. Try to write the cleanest code, avoid bugs, help everyone you can, as often as you can, read about leadership and ownership, experiment with new ideas and ask questions, etc. Find a mentor, or just find someone you really respect and want to emulate. Ask them questions, get over that fear of looking stupid and figure out why they do what they do. All that stuff. The fastest way to level up is humility, diligence, and truly investing in yourself and your team, not for the purpose of seeking promotion, but for the purpose of bettering yourself and those around you for the sake of doing so.\n",
      "模型答案: After 10 years, you could chose one of the two paths i.e. Technical or Managerial. If you worked as a software engineer chances are that you will be more comfortable with code as oppose to managing people. Assuming that you are a good developer, you could become a team lead. Where part of the time you will be managing team and part of the time writing/reviewing code. If you do it for an year or two and you like managing people more, then you could become a project or product manager. On the other hand if you like code review you could become Technical Architect. Further down the road from Technical Architect, you could become Engineering Manager, where most of the time you are building team, reviewing code and doing research to find out the best solution beside managing team.\n",

      "模型答案: As a data analyst, I already had a good understanding of visualisation, basic stats, maths and some softwares. I then undertook a masters in data science, which made my transition easier as I was taught advanced stats, maths and programming. If you’re thinking about being a data scientist from being an analyst, the main difference is you go from being a part of a solution, to generating questions and answers that will bring value to a business or team, engaging in the full KDD process. Data analysts should only really switch to scientist if they are self-driven and have a problem-solving attitude (along with present and social skills), but overall I had a good transition into data science because I’m an independent problem solver.\n",

Most trades - plumbing, electrical, most construction jobs, etc. aren’t going to be done by robots, at least not in 30 years. Hair-dressers/ barbers, masseurs, etc., too. Humans will continue to be more adaptable, more reliable and cheaper. Doctors, nurses and other medical staff will have A.I and robot assistants, but still be done by people. Maybe in 100 years the robots will take over, but probably not even then - more like 150 to 200 years. Entertainment and sports, obviously - although CGI will blur the lines a lot, it will still be cheaper to hire real people. That includes actors on TV/ streaming services, newsreaders and all of the people in the background who don’t show up on screen. Teaching, marketing, management and other jobs will also remain - again, they will have plenty of computer/ A.I. assistance programs, but the actual work will be done by human beings. Lawyers and police will still be done by humans in 30 years - although the investigation tools will be better. Careers in farming and fishing will have better tools to make them more efficient (A.I driven tractors may be a thing in 30 years) but will still need a human to tell the robots what to do and to make sure the work is done properly. There will still be chefs/ cooks and waitstaff - although more restaurants will have the customer input orders through a kiosk or electronic menu. A list of jobs that COULD be replaced would probably be shorter.\n",
      "模型答案: There are many jobs that can't be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI) in the future, but it's hard for AI to do them. This is because humans are better at certain jobs, and AI tools may not be as good as humans. For example, humans are better at detecting emotions, understanding feelings, and dealing with unexpected situations. AI tools may not be as good at these things, so they may not be as useful in certain jobs. Additionally, humans are better at social interactions and understanding human emotions, which are not always easily translated into AI.\n",

So, the non tech companies desperately seek Technology talent. Apply for a mid sized Non-Tech Company. Tell them I will build everything from scratch. Give them direction. In a non tech company, even small things matter like setting up their Communication Channels like MS 365, Outlook, Google drive. Streamlining their processes and giving them a digital identity by setting up their website and app and blog and setting up their digital transformation, CRM system on Cloud. Once they see your talent, they will put you on highest pedestal. Every department and employee will see you as Messiah. You will be the defacto Lord for them.

      "模型答案: No, the demand for ML/AI engineers is expected to increase in the long term. While AI technology is advancing rapidly, it is unlikely that all jobs will be automated within a few years. However, the demand for skilled ML/AI engineers may decrease due to the increasing demand for other AI-related jobs such as data scientists and machine learning engineers. It is important to consider the long-term implications of AI technology and to focus on developing skills that are in demand in the future.\n",

Good programmers are good programmers because they've found and mastered an area of the discipline they particularly love. Mastering any one area of programming is ridiculously hard work, requiring a depth of understanding that most would find tiresome to learn and the people that do it are only good programmers if they then push that knowledge into new places to make things more efficient or solve a problem nobody considered or everyone believed to be insurmountable. Only programmers that love their work have what it takes and predicting what area you're going to love most is especially difficult when you've yet to taste much of what there is out there on offer. With that in mind, use the answers you gather here just to get you started and then every step along the way, when you find something that interests you to discover more about or push a little further, don't be afraid to take a potentially permanent diversion. To get you started, you first must appreciate there are many languages and subareas in programming. Most people end up working with the a language from the C family or Java as these are the most popular across the world. They are most popular because they are extremely powerful, general tools and there exists a library for almost any purpose imaginable. C++ and Java are the two most popular examples of object-oriented languages. These languages are the most versatile and Python is establishing itself as another great offering in this direction, boasting some intuitive features the others missed and have developed too far to efficiently work in. Java is also notable for running on a virtual machine. This means your Java code can run on any machine that has a version of the JVM, which is a useful feature but makes the language slower. Most people won't notice because it is fast enough for most purposes. C is not object-oriented but it is perhaps the fastest 'high level' language out there being very close to the hardware with minimal abstraction. Other higher level languages (more abstractions from hardware) tend to be built on top of C. Going further down than C there is Assembly code. This is the closest you get to hardware before writing directly in binary. Assembly programming is slow and laborious but it provides you with the fastest code. The majority of people are satisfied with the assembly code their compiler generates or hire a programmer with assembly experience just for the small amounts of code that need to run that little bit faster or else are rendered impractical. Assembly not fast enough for you? Well you could learn hardware and/or work with a hardware description language like VHDL. These languages are useful for generating hardware designed to perform just one task (or a few) really well and produce the plans for the hardware that goes into specialised electronics. If speed is not your greatest concern, you could instead go in the direction of other specialised languages/areas: Web programming is quite popular but not being a particular interest of mine I'm not the best to tell you about its offerings.HTML is not a real language but it may be helpful to know the basics. CSS is gaining popularity but isn't a universal thing just yet and the field is yet to settle; it also exists only really to describe how pages should be laid out. PHP is a far more general web programming language but I believe JavaScript is considered the simplest and best place to begin if you're just after a taste of things.Web programming is split into client and server side areas of interests with the deepest and most technical side being the server which aims to keep things as simple for the client as possible whilst doing the least work it has to so it may serve many users quickly. Logic programming is another specialised area which probably has its biggest focus right now in artificial intelligence though it also looks at topics such as multi-agent systems theorem proving etc. It is a natural direction to go in if you've studied logic and found that to be your greatest interest but it's mostly used only in academic circles. Prolog is a fun and simple language to play around with but you'll quickly discover its limitations for general programming. Nevertheless, its backtracking capability, flexible functions, and ability to rewrite itself at runtime make it quite fun to use and a great choice for any compatible problem type. If artificial intelligence is an interest then you're more likely to want to look at machine learning and one of the more powerful, general languages discussed earlier. You may also need to develop your maths further to get to grips with a lot of its algorithms. MATLAB is an extremely powerful (if a little slow) a language for anything requiring matrices (or vectors or multidimensional tables etc.). This makes it good for Computer Vision, Neural Networks, statistics, big data analysis etc. Graphics also tend to be matrix based but this language is probably far too slow for that. If data analysis or graphics are an interest, consider looking at R; it is a fun, simple, powerful language that practically everybody who uses it loves. Functional programming concerns itself with problems that take in a set of various alphanumeric inputs and produce one output. If your problems of interest match this class, you're in for a treat as these languages are some of the most simple, intuitive, and fun to work with. Haskell is a brilliant example. In terms of hireabilty, functional programmers do well in banking and I suspect there are good opportunities in consultancy. This list is inexhaustive of the options and greatest languages out there to work with but hopefully will help you discover where you want to go searching first. In terms of books, I make no suggestions. You're probably better off asking a separate question for that but really no book is a substitute for just picking up a language and playing around with it. There are many good resources online too to help you learn but the best way I know of learning is doing; simply continuously set yourself tasks that are just a little beyond your current capabilities and get to solving them! Books and other resources exist just for turning to when you get a little stuck; you get past your hurdle and move on. Teach yourself as you go and try to do a little bit of programming every day (new code, not just code maintainance) so you never put it down for too long and lose your progress. Good programmers think and dream in code...\n",
      "模型答案: Assistant: A good learning path to learn programming languages for a first-year computer science and engineering student is to start with Python, then move to Java or C++, and finally to a personal language. For intermediate students, the road map is to understand object-oriented programming and functional programming, and to explore different programming paradigms like C, C++, Java, and C#, and finally to learn a personal language. For advanced students, the road map is to learn how to use high-level programming languages like C++ and Java, and to understand the theory behind them. For those who are passionate about programming, the road map is to make their own programming language and implement a compiler and interpreter for it. Consistent coding practice, engaging with the community, and continuous learning are also important for success.\n",

Prioritization: From this distillation of information, it’s a product manager’s responsibility to help prioritize products or features that their team should be focusing on as well as convincing their team and upper management to get on board with the vision that they’ve laid out based on their analysis and prioritization. A product manager must also work with the rest of the team to lay out an actionable plan to execute these proposed ideas. Execution: Once it comes time for the team to start building the product, a product manager must ensure that details are taken care of, edge cases are accounted for, and make sure the product is tested and ready to ship on time. And once the product is finally shipped, the job isn’t done. A product manager needs to determine success of the product through an understanding of how customers interact with the product. This feedback gives a product manager even more context and data to adjust future iterations of the product as well as help better plan ongoing roadmap plans and product ideas.

      "模型答案: Almost none. Sorry, but that's usually the truth. A big part of being an effective product manager is having a deep understanding of the market and (hopefully) a deep understanding of the technology that your company or product is using to solve valuable market problems.

Yes, I know - they're new, they're \"fresh\", they have no preconceptions. Yep, heard them all. And sometimes that's \"interesting\", and occasionally it's \"valuable\" -- but I can get the same perspective from a new grad who's working in support, or as a sales engineer, or a project manager. There are a few programs out there that focus on product management as a discipline...but as with the certification programs out there, I fear that they focus on the \"what\" and not so much on the \"why\" -- which is the key point for an effective PM. As the profession evolves, this will (hopefully) change, and PMs who come out of dedicated programs will be better-versed in different industries and\n",

Let me start with the bad one. The bad one is “this person is kind of like me”. The really bad version is “the candidate is White or Asian male in his early twenties, and so am/was I, so I kind of feel a personal connection”. This usually happens subconsciously, because most people don’t intend to be racist/sexist/whatever and to violate the law, but they can’t help finding it easier to connect with someone like that. A better, but still bad version, is the one I can confess to. I came across a candidate at Google and he, like me, started coding as a little kid, and he did math and coding olympiads like me, and he is just a typical computer geek with thick glasses and low social skills, you know, like me. So naturally I liked him. And he is like many people at Google in terms of his background. I actually don’t remember or cared what racial or other category he was, it was all about his interests. And then I realized that this was also bad, because that’s not what I am supposed to judge him on. So in my feedback I wrote this, “I think X would be a great fit for Google, but I think I am biased because he is so much like me”. And I left it to the hiring committee to sort this out. Google makes it explicit that you are not supposed to use the above approach. So what’s a good version? It should be based entirely on the interview. If you talk to a candidate, and he treats you as a colleague, with neither undue deference, nor condescension, that’s Googley. If he is excited to solve a problem because it’s really cool, that’s Googley. If he tells you about his excitement about working at Google in a genuine way, that’s Googley. If he can demonstrate to you that he has genuine ethical values, that’s Googley. In short, if the candidate’s behavior shows that he is someone you want to work with, that’s what Googley is supposed to be about.\n",

      "问题: Should a data scientist have deep or extensive knowledge of neural networks to do his job?\n",
      "标准答案: Depends. My employers have never wanted to use them, and much of the data I've worked with is not sufficient for deep learning to converge. Many regulated industries avoid neural networks and deep learning because they are black boxes. Many business units have similar sentiments. However, if you're a tech company, it's likely you'll need to know deep learning.\n",
      "模型答案: Yes, only if you want to call yourself a data scientist. Big data engineering and data analyst job profile don't explicitly need understanding of neural networks. Deep neural architecture design is intricate process which is highly tailored to data framework and end applications. Approach for time series continuous data application is different than approach for image processing applications. You need mathematical understanding of dimensionality reduction, hidden layer value propagation, pruning and probability theory for deep neural network design.\n",

They’ve helped so many people save hundreds, secure their family’s future, and grow their bank accounts—myself included. And honestly? Putting them to use was way easier than I expected. I bet you can knock out at least three or four of these right now—yes, even from your phone. Don’t wait like I did. 1. Cancel Your Car Insurance You might not even realize it, but your car insurance company is probably overcharging you. In fact, they’re kind of counting on you not noticing. Luckily, this problem is easy to fix. Don’t waste your time browsing insurance sites for a better deal. A company called Insurify shows you all your options at once — people who do this save up to $996 per year. If you tell them a bit about yourself and your vehicle, they’ll send you personalized quotes so you can compare them and find the best one for you. Tired of overpaying for car insurance? It takes just five minutes to compare your options with Insurify and see how much you could save on car insurance. 2. Ask This Company to Get a Big Chunk of Your Debt Forgiven A company called National Debt Relief could convince your lenders to simply get rid of a big chunk of what you owe. No bankruptcy, no loans — you don’t even need to have good credit. If you owe at least $10,000 in unsecured debt (credit card debt, personal loans, medical bills, etc.), National Debt Relief’s experts will build you a monthly payment plan. As your payments add up, they negotiate with your creditors to reduce the amount you owe. You then pay off the rest in a lump sum. On average, you could become debt-free within 24 to 48 months. It takes less than a minute to sign up and see how much debt you could get rid of. 3. You Can Become a Real Estate Investor for as Little as $10 Take a look at some of the world’s wealthiest people. What do they have in common? Many invest in large private real estate deals. And here’s the thing: There’s no reason you can’t, too — for as little as $10. An investment called the Fundrise Flagship Fund lets you get started in the world of real estate by giving you access to a low-cost, diversified portfolio of private real estate. The best part? You don’t have to be the landlord. The Flagship Fund does all the heavy lifting. With an initial investment as low as $10, your money will be invested in the Fund, which already owns more than $1 billion worth of real estate around the country, from apartment complexes to the thriving housing rental market to larger last-mile e-commerce logistics centers. Want to invest more? Many investors choose to invest $1,000 or more. This is a Fund that can fit any type of investor’s needs. Once invested, you can track your performance from your phone and watch as properties are acquired, improved, and operated. As properties generate cash flow, you could earn money through quarterly dividend payments. And over time, you could earn money off the potential appreciation of the properties. So if you want to get started in the world of real-estate investing, it takes just a few minutes to sign up and create an account with the Fundrise Flagship Fund. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Real Estate Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund’s prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. 4. Get Up to $50,000 From This Company Need a little extra cash to pay off credit card debt, remodel your house or to buy a big purchase?

Totally worth it. 5. Grow Your Money 10x Faster With This Online Bank Account If you bank at a traditional brick-and-mortar bank, your money probably isn’t growing much (c’mon, 0.40% is basically nothing). But there’s good news: With SoFi Checking and Savings (member FDIC), you stand to gain up to a hefty 3.80% APY on savings when you set up a direct deposit or have $5,000 or more in Qualifying Deposits and 0.50% APY on checking balances — savings APY is 10 times more than the national average. Right now, a direct deposit of at least $1K not only sets you up for higher returns but also brings you closer to earning up to a $300 welcome bonus (terms apply). You can easily deposit checks via your phone’s camera, transfer funds, and get customer service via chat or phone call. There are no account fees, no monthly fees and no overdraft fees. And your money is FDIC insured (up to $3M of additional FDIC insurance through the SoFi Insured Deposit Program). It’s quick and easy to open an account with SoFi Checking and Savings (member FDIC) and watch your money grow faster than ever. 6.

Plus, Penny Hoarder readers will get an extra 500 points for registering and another 1,000 points after completing their first survey. It takes just a few minutes to sign up and take your first survey, and you’ll receive your points immediately. 7. Earn $1000/Month by Reviewing Games and Products You Love Okay, real talk—everything is crazy expensive right now, and let’s be honest, we could all use a little extra cash.

I'm less inclined to hire product managers who \"work on\", \"were part of a team that\", etc. Be truthful. Don't say you owned something that you worked on within a team, but by all means if you did initiate, create or own a major product, feature or initiative say so clearly on your resume.

I'm less inclined to hire product managers who \"work on\", \"were part of a team that\", etc. Be truthful. Don't say you owned something that you worked on within a team, but by all means if you did initiate, create or own a major product, feature or initiative say so clearly on your resume. For example: \"Overall responsibility for converting new (i.e. trial) users into active users, including strategy, project idea generation, and project prioritization.\"Describe Your Leadership Experience - Even if you're applying for an individual contributor role, state what leadership experience you've had. Mention number and duration of direct reports, interns/junior PM's you've mentored, or other ways you've led others.Use Data - Imagine the reader saying, \"So what?\" after reading every sentence of your resume. If there is something impressive about what you did, answer the question. Ideally, answer it with data and communicate it appropriately. For example: \"Grew world-wide trial-to-active user conversion from 10.6% for FY 2009 to 14.2% for FY 2010, an increase of 360bps\".Skip the Objective and Summary Sections - Your objective is to get a job at my company. I know that if I'm looking at your resume. Skip the boilerplate objective that says you're looking for a challenging, blah, blah role. Also skip the summary section that discusses your qualities. Saying you are a seasoned leader in a summary doesn't convince anyone. The roles, accomplishments and deliveries in your resume are where you can demonstrate this.Pick the Right Technical Skills to Include - If you have built technology yourself or are adept at SQL and other query languages then go ahead and add a technical skills section. Skip the section if you're just using it to show that you are familiar with the MSOffice Suite and Windows 7.Make Sure it Matches Your LinkedIn Profile - The first thing I do when I get a resume is look a candidate up on LinkedIn. I scan their profile and look at mutual connections. If I see different stuff there than on your resume (e.g. a degree in progress vs. a completed degree) then warning bells go off. Fix it.Find a Messenger - Avoid submitting a resume through a company's job site. If possible, try to find out who the hiring manager is, then find mutual connections. LinkedIn works great for this. If you can, email it to them directly with a very brief cover letter. If you can't, find someone you know at the company who can refer you. Some companies pay a referral bonus so if you're going to go through a referrer who's not the hiring manager send your resume to them first. Don't submit it through the jobs site and then email it to your contact.Finally, a word on cover letters. Some hiring managers like them, some don't. I don't. A long cover letter might actually delay me in reviewing the resume, since I feel I need to slog through the cover letter as well. If you must add a cover letter, then simply name drop and pick one or two of your most meaningful accomplishments.\n",

Too many “average” people don’t try, when even small changes would make them stand out.Your “average,” now, is learning how to do things with a computer that 100s of elite scientists couldn’t dream of doing a few centuries ago. What you are learning to do can be applied in myriad ways over your career to change the world. You could assist in anything from space exploration to discovering a new medical therapy to taming fusion power to keeping utilities working for millions to enabling disabled people to live independently to educating poor children in countries around the world…and more. That’s really powerful, and most of it will be done by “average” people doing those extraordinary things together.\n",

If your goal is to work in a particular industry, try to find opportunities in the field you want to work in or one closely related to it. If you cannot find work, try to identify why you're not getting callbacks or job offers. Is it that you lack a particular skill that is common to the field you're aiming for? At the same time, when you're unable to find work in your target industry, try to work on projects that will demonstrate competence in that area. As for hiring in data analytics, it may be hard to find internships in that field at large companies until you're a rising senior or in a master's. It's a hot area to work in so you're going to be competing with seniors, recent grads, and grad students (some possibly at the PhD level as well). You should have a list of places you'd want to work and identify as precisely as possible what roles you're trying to get hired for. Do some research on what skills people in that industry have and expect. I'd guess R, Python, MATLAB, SAS, or language is desired. VBA scripting may also be desirable in some places. Version control, probably using git, will be a requirement almost everywhere, and it would be challenging to do analytics if you didn't know a little SQL. But you will need to figure out exactly what is required for the roles you're targeting. Bottom line: try to get internships or work if you can. If that fails, build projects you can easily show people using the skills you would use in the target role. A tip here is to build a PowerPoint deck of those projects which you can share with your resume when getting started. Or put them on a personal website (these are easy to build using Hugo, and Google will service a domain name for about 12 bucks a year; azure or netlify makes hosting a site pretty easy as well via a git repository).\n",
      "模型答案: It's generally recommended to gain experience in the field of data analysis before looking for internships, as this can help you develop the skills and knowledge necessary for success in the field. However, it's also possible to find internships in data analysis even if you don't have prior experience in the field. It's a good idea to research potential internship opportunities in data analysis, as well as other relevant fields, to get a sense of the types of positions available and the skills and experience required for success.\n",

If company B waits until the last minute, tell them that you need some more time since you are talking with company A. You are in a bidding war. Be professional, but don't be shy about taking bids. Also listen very closely. Company B might tell you that they can't offer more than company A, but working for company A is better because ...... Listen very carefully to what they are telling you.\n",
      "模型答案: Be honest. Tell company B that you'd love to work with them, provide reasons why and an overview of things you plan to accomplish there. Let them know that you're considering an offer from another company that has an expiration date and that you would love to hear back from them before that time. If they're smart and they want you they'll deliver an offer. If they're playing games during the offer stage they're either not a good company to work for or they're strongly considering other candidates. You can only negotiate effectively if you're honest and competent enough that they really want to hire you.\n",

      "模型答案: No, there are no care/support jobs that give sponsorship to international students in the UK. However, there are other visas available to international students, such as the Post Study Work visa, which can help them find employment in the UK and stay in the country for up to 2 years. If they find a job paying a minimum salary of £25,600 or £23000, they can apply for a Skilled Worker's visa which will allow them to stay in the UK permanently. From Summer 2022 a new visa, known as the Scale-up visa, will also run alongside the Skilled Worker's visa, which will allow international students to stay in the UK for up to 3 years if they find a job paying a minimum salary of £33,000.\n",

      "模型答案: The top three skills that a product manager should develop in order to advance their career are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Be aware. This applies to everything: the product, your team, yourself. It's easy to get caught up with the details of a project and miss the big picture. It's also easy to get caught up in the routine you've established for you and your team and not realizing it's not working. Take a step back and observe your assumptions, your existing practices, and your performance; you'll be surprised what you'll realize.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Be adaptable. In addition to being aware, you need to adapt to the new information. Products evolve, prototypes fail, and people's needs change. If the product isn't solving the right problem, change course. If a meeting is no longer productive, cancel it. If you need more help, ask. Understand sunk cost and do what it takes to move the product in the right direction.\n",

      "3. Be proactive. I once heard an analogy that product management is like filling in the white space between the different roles. I think it's a really important attitude to have.

Creative AI: Fields such as AI-driven content creation (writing, design, video production) have opened doors for creative professionals who work with AI tools to produce digital media, marketing content, and custom designs. 2. Job Displacement and Automation in Repetitive Roles Manufacturing and Manual Labor: Automation continues to replace many routine, manual, and repetitive jobs in sectors like manufacturing, logistics, and warehousing. Robots and automated systems now handle tasks like assembly, quality control, and inventory management. Customer Service and Support: AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants are replacing human customer service agents in many sectors, especially for routine queries. This affects roles in call centers, help desks, and support services. Administrative Roles: Jobs in administration, such as data entry, scheduling, and basic bookkeeping, are increasingly automated. Software tools powered by AI are capable of handling many clerical tasks that used to require human oversight. Retail: In the retail sector, self-checkout systems and AI-driven inventory management are replacing roles traditionally held by cashiers and stock clerks. Automation is also improving delivery systems, reducing the need for human labor in logistics. 3. Emerging Opportunities in Human-AI Collaboration AI-augmented Professions: In fields like medicine, law, and finance, AI is transforming professions by assisting with diagnosis, contract analysis, and financial modeling. Professionals are now expected to work alongside AI tools to improve decision-making and enhance their productivity. For example: Doctors use AI for more accurate diagnostics and treatment plans. Lawyers rely on AI to sift through large volumes of legal data to find relevant precedents. Financial analysts leverage AI to identify market trends and investment opportunities more efficiently. Skills-based Roles: Workers are now required to have AI literacy in order to augment their existing skills. In fields like marketing, sales, and product management, AI tools help employees optimize campaigns, analyze customer data, and automate workflows. 4. Job Shifts in Healthcare and Education Healthcare Innovation: AI is transforming healthcare, not just through automation but by enabling new diagnostic tools, personalized treatment, and predictive healthcare. This has created new roles for AI specialists in healthcare, biotech researchers, and telemedicine experts. Education and Training: As AI tools assist in personalized learning and e-learning, new roles for e-learning designers, AI tutors, and education technology developers have emerged. Additionally, there is a growing demand for trainers who can help workers upskill in AI and automation technologies. 5. Reskilling and Upskilling Opportunities AI Training Programs: To stay competitive, workers are increasingly participating in reskilling programs designed to help them learn new AI-related skills. Companies and online platforms offer training in areas like data analysis, AI programming, and automation management. Hybrid Skill Sets: Workers with a mix of domain expertise (e.g., healthcare, law, marketing) and AI proficiency are highly valued. These hybrid roles allow professionals to leverage automation and AI tools in their industry-specific contexts, leading to increased productivity and better decision-making. 6. Increased Focus on Soft Skills Emotional Intelligence: Roles that require human interaction, empathy, and emotional intelligence, such as in healthcare, education, and human resources, remain difficult for AI to replace. There is an emphasis on workers developing strong communication, critical thinking, and creativity to complement AI capabilities. Leadership and Strategy: As companies integrate AI, leadership roles are evolving to require a combination of technological and strategic expertise. Executives and managers who can guide AI adoption and make data-driven decisions are in high demand. 7. AI and Automation in Remote Work Remote Work Tools: The rise of AI has contributed to the development of remote work technologies, such as AI-powered collaboration platforms, virtual assistants, and workflow automation tools. These innovations have created new roles in remote team management, virtual collaboration, and online learning. Gig Economy: The gig economy continues to thrive as AI-powered platforms make it easier for people to find short-term or freelance work. Jobs related to content creation, data entry, and task-based labor are increasingly automated, but workers are still needed to manage these platforms and provide human oversight when necessary. Overall Impact on the Job Market in 2025 Transformation, Not Elimination: While some jobs are automated, AI is not eliminating the job market—it is transforming it. Many traditional roles are evolving, with workers needing to adapt and learn new skills in order to stay competitive. Faster Job Creation: For every job that gets automated, new positions are being created, often in entirely new fields. However, there is a need for proactive reskilling and government policies to ensure that displaced workers can transition into these emerging fields. Uneven Adoption: The impact of AI and automation varies greatly between industries. Highly repetitive roles are more likely to be automated, while professions requiring creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence are more resilient to automation.\n",
      "模型答案: to 1000 years of human history, including the entire 20th century. It is in the course of this evolution that I propose the emergence of the artificial intelligence. This is my personal view and it is based on the assumption that the artificial intelligence is capable of surviving the collapse of the human race and is therefore capable of surviving the collapse of the world in which it has evolved. It is the emergence of this artificial intelligence that I describe as the emergence of an entirely new life form and I believe that the artificial intelligence will evolve into a new life form in the near future. The artificial intelligence has at its disposal all the accumulated knowledge accessible from the Internet and every device with an Internet connection, including all sensors, cameras, vehicles and robots. With these resources it clearly vastly surpasses human intelligence. In the story the new artificial intelligence takes over control of the planet in the aftermath of a nuclear war devastated countries agree to establish an institution similar to the United Nations but with more authority, with a mandate to prevent future wars, to clean up environmental damage and to ensure the survival of human life.

These are different forms of communication, but the process of bringing them to fruition has a necessary, sometimes overlooked step: editing! Unless you’re a professional writer, it’s unlikely that you have an editor who can review your writing regularly. Here are some tips to help you review your own work.Give your writing some space. Have you ever felt a mix of pure relief and joy when you’ve finished a draft of something? Don’t downplay that feeling and the ability to walk away from your work before you start editing it. You may need minutes, hours, or days, but once you sit back down with what you originally had on the page, you’ll have the thrill of looking at it with fresh eyes. You’ll notice errors you may not have seen the first time. You’ll come to new realizations about its overall tone and structure. If it’s a text or email, maybe you only need a few minutes away from it. If it’s a story or essay, perhaps you’ll need longer. Regardless of what type of work it is, it will help your writing tremendously.Don’t use overachieving synonyms. Looking at your work for the second, third, or fourth time around may inspire you to spice up your language with longer, more uncommon words. There’s nothing wrong with having a thesaurus nearby, but try to limit the repetition of long, pretentious-feeling words so your work flows well and doesn’t feel too bogged down. At the end of the day, you want it to feel true to you and the message you’re conveying.Remember who the reader is. Don’t forget your own voice as the writer—but don’t forget who your reader is. Many writers get too close to their work; editing is a chance to try to get out of your own head. Who is your ideal reader? What do you want them to take away from the writing? It’s a unique time to step in their shoes, to make sure your communication is as effective as you’d like it to be.Kill your darlings. Don’t be scared to remove chunks of your work, even if it feels precious to you. If it’s a passage that’s really tough to part with, try saving it somewhere else, so you can return to it later in your piece or for another work.Use Grammarly. Last but not least, Grammarly has countless resources for editing your work. Our writing assistant helps you find areas of your writing that are unclear or too wordy, as well as help you find mistakes you might not have caught.Editing may feel tedious, but it’s just as important as writing itself.

Should that dev decide he wants to advance himself into project management, yes that would be great.\n",
      "模型答案: No. The use of white board in interview has been highly divisive. Historically, there was a time where software engineering interviews were very similar in form to an oral exam. Trick questions were generally ok, interviewers wanted to see candidates think on their feet. In the 2010s, an increasingly number of folks, both candidates and employers, started to question that method and felt that it led to rejecting qualified prospective employees. Some went up to banning the coding interview altogether. But, by the end of the 2010s, the typical software interviewing experience was in person, and included coding exercises on a laptop with the candidate code expected to run. White boards were present in interview rooms and candidates would often use them as a brainstorming device. Companies like hackerrank or codepair proposed platforms on which candidates could be evaluated. Some companies, and most significantly Google, were strong proponent of having the candidates write code on an actual whiteboard. They argued that this emphasized reasoning as opposed to syntax - whether the code made sense was more important than whether it ran. This also allowed candidates to write some “pseudo-code” for some less important part of the exercise. The form of the interview changed completely with the COVID pandemic.

You seem to be asking about experiences in industry since obviously there is a huge difference between a Master's and a PhD in academia. My PhD in artificial intelligence (AI) had a pretty strong influence on my career in industry in both positive and negative ways for a LONG time (over a decade) after graduation. On the positive side, it often opened doors for me at companies that had an interest in AI that would not have hired me without that degree. On the negative side, I was also limited by the AI label a lot, and I often found it difficult to be taken seriously as a \"general purpose\" programmer even with years of experience with more mainstream technologies outside of the limited AI space. If the job was AI related at all, I was usually hired on the spot--but anything else and I was not seriously considered, even though I felt I had a lot more in my bag of tricks than just AI. It took a long time--it wasn't until a decade or so after finishing my PhD that I really started to make the transition--but I did eventually move away from the AI label. I...\n",
      "模型答案: It depends. If you're pursuing jobs in your area of CS expertise: It will help you a lot. In some cases, it will be strictly required. If you're pursuing jobs outside your area of CS expertise: It won't make much of a difference, on average. In some companies, it will help you a bit. It other companies, it will hurt you. And in a lot of companies, they just won't care at all. PhD students likely perform worse on technical interviews than non-PhDs. PhDs are often out of practice with coding. Or, if they do code, it's in a more obscure language. And, PhDs often attract people who didn't want to go into industry in the first place. Ultimately, at the top tech companies, you'll be judged based on your interview performance, not your resume. That said: It is idiotic to pursue a PhD to make yourself more employable. You will not get a significantly higher salary and you will not make yourself more hirable. Instead, you will spend about 5 years at a tiny stipend (with an opportunity cost of about $50,000 - $100,000 / year) only to get a tiny bump in salary\n",

      "标准答案: One of the biggest things I struggled with early on was knowing when to stop investing in something and pivot to something else. It’s really easy to explain this concept to someone, but a whole other ordeal to live it and have to make the call yourself. As a new PM, I didn’t have experience working on projects where we cut scope or we didn’t “finish” what we initially agreed to.

It’s really easy to explain this concept to someone, but a whole other ordeal to live it and have to make the call yourself. As a new PM, I didn’t have experience working on projects where we cut scope or we didn’t “finish” what we initially agreed to. My priors were based on school projects and internships which, in all cases, your goal is literally to finish the task you’ve been given. You can push back at internships, but you likely won’t get very far if you go to a professor and try to explain why you shouldn’t have to do your homework. One piece of advice I give to people who are deciding between starting out as a new grad PM (especially when you’re not going to an APM program) vs. as an engineer, designer, data scientist, etc is that transitioning later on may help address this struggle that I had. For me, I had to learn this skill on the job while leading a team. But, if you started out in a different function, you might have the opportunity to work on projects where the scope gets cut or pivoting happens, which gives you some experiences to draw from and examples to pattern match against.The other major struggle I have that I think is a “wake up call” to most new grad PMs who don’t have PM internship experience is that it’s tough to start our first job and feel like you’re starting from zero. This is especially tough for overachievers, which probably represents a ton of people who want to be product managers. Another factor that makes this difficult is that there are very tangible ways to measure progress and “grade” yourself in school (and in engineering, to some extent). These things don’t translate into Product Management, so for the first months I was constantly worried that I wasn’t growing or that I wasn’t meeting expectations. Thankfully, I have a great manager and team who have taught me countless lessons and have helped me understand the impact I’m having, even when I was new. I also had to often remind myself that it was okay that I was struggling and that I consciously decided to make a career switch to a function that I didn’t directly train for in college. That’s not to say that there weren’t extremely difficult times, but I managed to work through the periods of self doubt thanks to the awesome mentors I have around me.All in all, starting out as a product manager (instead of transitioning later on) isn’t impossible, but it does come with its challenges. Neither is better or worse for all people or in all situations. There were a lot of struggles, but I wouldn’t trade my experience for anything. If you’re going to start as a PM straight out of college, I think you both have to be emotionally prepared to push through the tough times and also find a company and team where you have strong mentorship and support. I also wrote a related answer about what it’s like to be a PM when you’re also younger than many other people on your team[1] .Footnotes[1] Elynn Lee's answer to In a product management role, is it challenging being younger than many of the other people on your team?\n",

      "标准答案: It should not hurt but some employers prefer not to hire with non compete since there is the potential for a lawsuit even if it lacks merit. That said, it is always a good idea to attach the non compete document or an excerpt from it ( the clause dealing with the specifics) with your application. Since employers may not read it or may not be comfortable interpreting the legal language, you should provide a brief explanation in your cover letter. It should be noted that non competes have to be reasonable to be enforceable.

That said, it is always a good idea to attach the non compete document or an excerpt from it ( the clause dealing with the specifics) with your application. Since employers may not read it or may not be comfortable interpreting the legal language, you should provide a brief explanation in your cover letter. It should be noted that non competes have to be reasonable to be enforceable. It cannot be so broad as to prevent someone from earning a livelihood and it cannot cover too long a time period, for the same reason. At the same time, the business has to be protected. A fine balance but usually not a difficult one. In this case, since it is not in the same industry (although there are situations where there could be overlap or a relationship), that would be of some assistance provided the employer looks at it objectively. Finally, it is not uncommon, where the employee is leaving on good terms and joining a non competitor, for the current employer to provide a letter waiving the noncompete. In that case, your answer on the application as to whether there is a non compete, would be “no”.\n",
      "模型答案: Answering \"yes\" to whether you are subject to a non-compete agreement can potentially raise concerns for an employer, even if the industries are different. Here are some key points to consider:Employer's Perspective: Employers may worry about the risk of legal issues or complications if they hire someone bound by a non-compete agreement. They might fear that you could be restricted in your ability to perform certain tasks or share industry knowledge.Relevance of Non-Compete: If your non-compete agreement is specific to a particular role or industry, and the new position is unrelated, you might want to clarify this in your application or interview. Providing context can help alleviate concerns.Transparency: Being honest about your non-compete status is important, as employers value transparency. However, you should also be prepared to discuss the specifics of the agreement and how it relates to the job you're applying for.Potential Impact: While it may not automatically disqualify you, it could influence the employer's decision. They may opt for candidates without such restrictions to avoid potential complications.Legal Consultation: If you're uncertain about the implications of your non-compete agreement, consider consulting with a legal professional to understand your rights and any potential limitations it may impose.In summary, while answering \"\n",

Consider your team’s skills, budget, and the time required for each approach.Brand Positioning: - Ensure your brand messaging resonates with both audiences.

But you know how it is – the internet is full of scams and shady-grady stuff, so I spent weeks trying to find something legit. And I finally did! Freecash surprised me in all the right ways. I’ve earned over $1,000 in one month without ‘living’ on the platform. I was skeptical right up until the moment I cashed out to my PayPal. What is Freecash all about? Basically, it’s a platform that pays you for testing apps and games and completing surveys. This helps developers improve their applications while you make some money.You can earn by downloading apps, testing games, or completing surveys. I love playing games, so that’s where most of my earnings came from (oh, and my favorites were Warpath, Wild Fish, and Domino Dreams).There’s a variety of offers (usually, the higher-paying ones take more time).Some games can pay up to $1,000 for completing a task, but these typically require more hours to finish.On average, you can easily earn $30–50/day.You pick your options — you’re free to choose whatever apps, games, and surveys you like.Of course, it’s not like you can spend 5 minutes a day and become a millionaire. But you can build a stable income in reasonable time, especially if you turn it into a daily habit. Why did I like Freecash?It’s easy. I mean it. You don’t have to do anything complicated. All you need is to follow the task and have some free time to spend on it. For some reason, I especially enjoyed the game Domino Dreams. My initial goal was to complete chapter 10 to get my first $30, but I couldn’t stop playing and ended up completing chapter 15. It was lots of fun and also free money: $400 from that game alone.No experience needed. Even if you’ve never done any ‘testing’ before, you can do this. You get straightforward task descriptions, so it’s impossible to go wrong. A task you might expect is something like: Download this game and complete all challenges in 14 days.You can do it from anywhere. I was earning money while taking the bus, chilling on the couch, and during my breaks.Fast cashing out. I had my earnings in my PayPal account in less than 1 day. I’m not sure how long it takes for other withdrawal methods (crypto, gift cards, etc.), but it should be fast as well.You can earn a lot if you’re consistent. I’ve literally seen users in the Leaderboard making $3,000 in just one month. Of course, to get there, you need time, but making a couple of hundred dollars is really easy and relatively fast for anyone.Don’t miss these PRO tips to earn more: I feel like most users don’t know about these additional ways to make more money with Freecash:Free promo codes: You can follow Freecash on social media to get weekly promo codes for free coins, which you can later exchange for money.Daily rewards and bonuses: If you use the platform daily, you’ll get additional bonuses that help you earn more.In-app purchases to speed up processes: While playing, you can buy items to help speed up task completion. It’s optional, but it really saved me time, and I earned 4x more than I spent.Choose the highest-paying offers: Check New Offers and Featured Offers to get the best opportunities that pay the most.Honestly, I still can’t believe I was able to earn this much so easily. And I’ve actually enjoyed the whole process. So, if you’re looking for some truly legit ways to earn money online, Freecash is a very good option.\n",

If you start your day earlier, you might have time for some other things then work later that day. You know, like friends :) 2. Protect yourself - When giving time estimates add some safety extra. Surely this should be done by your Project Manager, but they might fail big time and then it's on you. Unfair sure, but that's how it often goes. 3. Hobby code - There is no better way to protect yourself then becoming a better programmer. Always do own side projects and experiments. This way you can try new things without pressure. After some time you can bring these new skills to your work without a risk. It's also fun.\n",

When I was younger I managed a customer service department and I would get in applications that were 3 pages long. I had 50 applications to get through, a week to hire a new representative and didn't have time to read a novel so those ones got put to the bottom of the stack. I would suggest keeping it to one page if at all possible. 4. Don't print your resume on both sides of the paper To tie in with the last point, if it does go over one page, DO NOT print the second page on the back side of the first. Print it on a separate page. Again, applications are initially skimmed through at a vigorous pace and if there is something printed on the back that's vital information about you, it mostly likely will never be seen and you risk your resume looking unfinished. 5. Have 3 solid references who are not related to you. This is basic for any application you've ever filled out and it's likely they will never get called but in the off chance that your future employer does call, don't rely on Uncle Ricky to secure you that position.\n",

You would be fortunate to work for such a company. Many software engineers for example are known for introversion, which isn’t a bad thing. They are highly productive and prone to high focus which are great assets to productivity. They are not known however for their ability to work as part of a larger network (sometimes) and unfortunately are sometimes viewed as uncooperative. Not true of course, but that sometimes is the perception of those who prefer to do solo or focused work. Because some organizations take a team approach integrating software engineers to be part of the process from inception working along with designers and project managers, the software engineers ability to communicate in ways that walk a line between technical and layman to the other team members is important. Different disciplines often speak in different language or jargon. The difficulties that come these frustrations of not feeling heard, or understood sometimes show up in the form of behaviors that are passive aggressive, or sometimes not as friendly as they could be. Thus, it’s likely the company would rather know the strong suits of a candidate or where they might need to apply development from the outset. This way they can make placement with the most compatible teams or strongest managers as necessary. And, this is all to the the happiest outcome of the existing team and the new hire. So, it’s not necessarily a negative request to have that interview....\n",
      "模型答案: Behavioral interviews are necessary for software engineering positions because they allow recruiters to assess the skills that technical interviews cannot. They form the last piece of the puzzle and are used to more confidently estimate the level of a candidate. Behavioral interviews are particularly useful for senior candidates and above.\n",

Certifications DO NOT matter. I repeat certifications do not matter. Certifications are like icing on the cake but without cake you have no value for icing. So to answer your question how can you get a job as a cyber security expert, it depends on lot of things 1. Your background 2. Your interest (red team versus blue team: red team attacks and blue team defends and both are equally important) 3. Market/job opportunity You can be an inch deep and miles wide in security or you can be inch wide and miles deep. For example there are different skill set required based on at which layer(network, OS,application , data) you are providing security. For example 1. Network security (IPS, proxy, web filtering, email filtering, firewall, APT detection, next gen firewall and so on ) 2. Endpoint security (mostly desktops,mobile and laptops) 3. Application security (code review, white box testing, black box testing and all three requires different kind of skill sets) 4. Server security (web server, application server, database servers) 5. Data security ( encryption, DRM, tokenization, compliance , data classification and policies and so forth) 6. Network forensics or endpoint forensics 7. Incident response and security monitoring 8 malware analysis and reversing 9. Hardware hacking (p0wning IoT devices smart meters, phones or Barbie dolls for fun) 10. Surveillance (man in the middle for cell phones, sessions , cookie stealing, and so on) These are some of the high level buckets you have to think about and what matches your background. But before you do that I would strongly advice following . 1. Read the entire TCP/IP illustrated volume I and when you finish it, read it one more time. If you can't finish the whole book atleast read first 10 chapters. You can thank me later. 2. Read basics of port scanning on Port Scanning Basics this will give you an idea on how the first stage of attack is (reconnaissance) is conducted. 3. Read up on cyber kill chain Title 4. Download kali from Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Linux Distribution and learn the tools by testing it on your own servers or desktops. DO NOT scan or run any attack tools from Kali on the digital asset you do not own. Laws are strict. 5. Once you are familiar with Kali and tools, Start with CTF (capture the flag) and try and solve few challenges. CTF365: Capture the Flag Now you have basics to conquer any advanced stuff in network and data security. For application security specially for white box testing or security code review you should have some programming background. Application security , malware reversing and security monitoring are really hot. Depending on the vertical you choose data security and compliance can be really in demand for example financial , healthcare or retail. Last but not least, there are ton of books on the topics I mentioned above , and ton of material on Phrack Magazine ::. Which is really advance. Now after all this if you say on top of this I have CISSP or CISA then it holds some water but it won't automatically get you a job just because you are CISSP . By the way there is an inside joke within security community but may be will table that for some other time. Good luck and I promise, you will never ever be bored in security. Regards, Vijay \"If you can see the invisible you can do the impossible\"P.S : the question was changed after it was answered. The initial question was how can you get a job as a cyber security expert and now it was change this is unfair to people who have spent time answering your initial question. If you wanted to change the question you should have asked separately.\n",

You have just learned the horse has also a back right leg, which you knew nothing about until very recently. Tail wagging is controlled by a committee. There was a memo on the direction where the horse is heading, but you’re not quite sure who was supposed to cascade that memo to you. No, seriously - the biggest difference is in the number of meetings. Big corp - there’s lots and lots of meetings. And then there’s some more. If you actually want to get some work done - you have to schedule it in your calendar, otherwise it ain’t gonna happen. But you have got to be really slick how you go about it. Split that time in smaller chunks, as everybody knows that large 4–5h “busy” blocks in the calendar usually mean DND time, and before you know it you’ll kiss that time goodbye too. Ok, now seriously seriously. Startup is 90% product, 10% management. Large corp is 10% product, 90% management. As a PM, you’re expected to thrive in completely different areas:Startup - scrappy, moves & builds momentum fast, ruthlessly prioritize.Large corp - manage everyone’s expectations, generate shared reality, provide broader context to your team(s).The key differentiation is also in how you manage the roadmap - its visibility, and the way a project gets on the roadmap. In a big company, you’re expected to have at least 9–12 months of clear roadmap visibility. This is essential, due to mutual dependency and overall constellation w/ other teams and divisions. In a startup, having an epic (a project, whatever) on the 6-month roadmap is usually a one-liner, e.g. “we want to do X”. That doesn’t fly in a big corp; mid-term roadmap projects are usually scoped, designed, reviewed with engineering, and estimated to a relatively high level of confidence. You are effectively building the support for a project - product marketing and other dept’s are acquainted with them on a very high level, and executives and senior leaders need to know about them and be aligned with your project. You’re equally concerned with making sure you deliver stuff, as you are with putting things into proper constellation 6 months from now. That basically means you’ll work on projects that may, or may not get close to execution. That’s something a startup can’t afford to do, and usually doesn’t. It’s like driving a sports car vs. driving a truck - you want to make a sharp left turn? Not so easy; you have to plan well ahead. Essentially, you’re compensating agility for the firepower. Another key facet of the different roadmap approach is the fact that a big corp has plenty of resources for which you’re competing with other projects/teams. A startup is by default very scarce with resources, hence putting a project on the roadmap comes with a completely different set of constraints. Every major decision could have serious consequences on growth, acquisition and/or revenue, which you might not have the opportunity to mitigate later on. In a big company, you’re usually concerned with getting a buy-in from various stakeholders on why is X such a great opportunity, vs. other valid opportunities a same team could be pursuing. Or, let me put it like this:Startup: You’re entering a maze. You have one bullet in your Glock 17 handgun. You hit a target, you get another bullet. BAM, hit that one too, here’s another bullet. And so on.Corp: There are four shooters in front of the maze, each holding an empty HK416 with grenade launcher and red dot sight. Their team leader is holding three mags ready to distribute to shooters he believes have the best chance of getting to the level boss.And that’s basically the core difference between being a PM in a startup and a PM in a large tech company. … oh, did I mention meetings?\n",

      "模型答案: A new grad with no experience has no business interviewing for a product management job. Also, a new grad with no experience may be the perfect person to interview for a product management job. I’m going to let that sink in for a moment. Product management is the discipline of translating market requirements into product requirements. To do this, product managers need to be able to listen with fresh ears, communicate what they hear without judgement, and bring some market-driven perspective to what they’ve found. Experienced product managers have the scar tissue to know how to navigate the reefs and shoals of product companies without getting themselves killed. It’s an exhilarating job. But as it has all the accountability with very little authority, it’s also an exhausting job. And that’s where the new grad brings something special. A savvy product company understands how hard it is to be a product manager, and has hired and burnt out scores of them over time. They understand the amount of work involved in paying attention to the marketplace, evaluating competition, surveying customers, documenting and testing requirements, and managing the labyrinth of software development over time. A savvy product company has built up systems within which product management can function - like a well-oiled gear - without forcing them to do more than they can do. This\n",

Unfortunately, being a manager doesn't automatically make you a are a leader. And the reason is most organisations (and the individuals within them) either don't fully understand or have a limited understanding of what leadership actually means.

Not every leader needs to be a manager, but everyone who is a manager should be a leader. Unfortunately, being a manager doesn't automatically make you a are a leader. And the reason is most organisations (and the individuals within them) either don't fully understand or have a limited understanding of what leadership actually means. There is no ready-made recipe for it however I summarised 5 crucial leadership attributes that new managers need to understand to lead their team effectively. Here they are:Self-awareness and leading by example: To display the desired behavioural changes, a leader must showcase them first. In organisations, managers often demand many things from their teams, saying, \"Let's do this,\" or \"Let's do that.\" However, they fail to do those things themselves. Do not expect others to do things you wouldn't do yourself. Change starts within oneself.Being barrier-free and transparent: You don't always have to appear strong and motivated in front of your teams. Instead, be transparent. Share openly when you lack motivation, make mistakes, or stumble. Show your team members that everyone is human, including yourself. Embedding this approach within the teams triggers a positive response.Building a strong team and continuous improvement: One of the most significant responsibilities of a leader is to build the right team and constantly strengthen it. This aspect is often overlooked. Your job is to manage the work, but you can only manage people. To manage people effectively, you must continuously uncover their abilities and talents and make the right hiring decisions. This is where you should invest most of your effort.Crafting a strategy and providing direction: As Seneca said, \"If a man knows not to which port he sails, no wind is favourable.\" Without clear goals, any tailwinds becomes useless.Focus on setting business objectives and removing obstacles to achieving them. Differentiate between work outputs and work objectives. For instance, saying, \"We have launched feature X\" is an output. However, if that feature didn't reduce our user acquisition costs, that's a result. One of the biggest mistakes is when managers constantly come up with their ow ideas or projects related to their team's area of expertise and engage in micro-management. Avoid doing this. Provide business objectives, and your team will be much more creative and effective in finding and implementing solutions to achieve those objectives. Your role is to clear the obstacles they encounter on the way to reaching those objectives.\n",

It is a good thing to let children be in turn the leader of a small group in order to develop a small project, like a sketch or a text or a letter. Each child can practice his/her skills and find out his/her strengths.\n",

They are ambitious, they are aspirational, but they lack Technology depth because remember the Cattle Coders went to Tech companies to become a Coolie there ?

      "模型答案: From the top: I'll try to answer your question. I think that it's going to be awhile before AI is useful in a habitual way as a software engineer or developer augmentation tool in a serious manner. This assessment is based on anecdotal evidence, folks, and is different from case to case. I would think that it would depend upon what you're trying to do and what code that AI has been trained on at the level of source code. If, as it looks to be likely, the code generated will still need human intervention before you can do much with it, people, you are not likely to see a lessening of jobs for software engineers and developers for the immediately foreseeable future. Five years from now? I think that software engineers and developers may see a shakeout amongst juniors who are less talented as the technology matures and the code available for training improves in quality and size of training data available increases. You're still going to need the human element when it comes to tasks requiring creativity and the ability to think sideways, that is to say outside of the box in a disciplined way when it comes to creativity and innovation.\n",

Which I encourage highly because it is a good thing and you should back yourself if you have invested quality time in a particular direction. But here’s the thing, while the assignments and programming exercises you did back during your courses taught you how to implement a lot of useful stuff, what they gave you ready and didn't make you do specifically is acquire and clean data which is easily 80% of Data Science. So that’s the first skill I want you to nail. I am listing down a few other skills that come to mind on careful pragmatic thought and I've arranged them priority wise although I highly recommend you tick off all of them before applying for an internship. Skill Number 1: Acquiring and Cleaning Data: It depends how you want to practice this. You could take up unclean datasets and clean them up or you could do a project with unclean data from start to the end. The second approach makes more sense if you don’t have projects to show on your CV. However, if you have done projects before, and have used unclean (raw) data in them to begin with, you can skip this and please, do not insult yourself by calling yourself a fresher. You’re better than that. Skill Number 2: Go back to the basics: And by basics, I mean statistics of course. Take a refresher course online on statistics and just brush through it. It might sound a little extra but speaking from practical experience, believe me a lot of “Data Scientists” lack even the basic statistical knowledge and as an interviewee, that is the one of the first things you’ll be checked for when you apply for internships. The first requirement to shine at an internship is to make sure you get in, right? Skill Number 3: Exploratory Data Analysis: This process involves generating questions, and investigating them with visualisations. One of the first tasks that I was given as an intern was to clean the data, and I quote my then superior, “give me creative visualisations of this data for me to present to my client”. This skill is underrated as hell. Everyone wants to just skip to the main course which is fine and the enthusiasm is understandable. But this skill is important as it makes you think from a business point of view and as data scientists, I emphasise heavily on developing that perspective. Understand the data, visualise the data, ask questions and then proceed in a direction. You don’t want to be a clueless data scientist who just tries model after model without a direction. Skill Number 4: Communication and Documentation: Effectively communicating results is what separates the good data scientists from the great ones. Ultimately, if you haven’t undertaken a research internship or assistantship, everything in the end is about selling a service or a product. It doesn’t matter how fancy your model is, if you can’t explain it your superiors or customers, you won’t get their buy-in. Also, for a research internship or really any internship, you need to be able to be good on paper. I mean good language, proper margins and formatting and a good clear sense of what you are trying to convey. This falls under the documentation domain which we usually run away from. Don’t anymore. A well documented research paper or report is necessary to make it stand out. If you can write it well, you can sell it well. I wish you all the good fortune. Nail it dude. And reach out to me if you need any assistance whatsoever. Cheers!\n",

At the company that created the dominant technologies for controlled delivery of drugs to body tissue (Transderm Scōp; Duragesic; Concerta), I saw our monthly employee database printout every month from 1980 - 2001. We were eerily 50–50, men and women. As VP of HR, it made one part of my job very gratifying. This was the result of our supervisory managers’ freehand decision-making. I didn’t have to go have a bunch of heart-to-heart talks. I wrote the nomination for our president to participate in a Silicon Valley award contest. From Fenwick.com’s Gender Diversity white paper 2014: Women were 46.8% of the U.S. labor force in 2013 and held 51.4% of management (considering all levels), professional and related positions in 2013. Here’s a point of reference based on research. One of the countless studies I read about the mechanisms of diversity or lack thereof described a “plateau effect”. That may not have been the article’s jargon. Its finding went something like this: changes in hiring patterns occur when a previously underrepresented group becomes numerous enough at the precursor levels that the decision-makers have more than one member of the non-traditional group among the finalists. If you have five finalists and two are women, they’re still a minority 60–40. But, the odds are far better than when you have four men and only one woman. “The only woman” is a tougher decision during a transitional era. Later, when it’s pretty natural, decision-makers are less likely to believe that they might be missing some disqualifying factor that tracks to gender.\n",

On average, I would say the women working tech roles in major tech companies are stronger than the men, particularly when we're talking Americans. Borderline cases get pushed out by sexism or something else along the education path or early in their careers, leaving only the really strong women.\n",

After release if we get some grand treat from management, that is also appreciated and enjoyed . like other jobs s/w engineers also like - appreciation work life balance support from boss Best thing happened during covid-19 pandemic lockdown , s/w engineers enjoyed very nice family life , though they were busy - they were along with their family . That was a great experience IT professionals had gone through - working from home for more than 2 years ( for majority of IT engineers). Again majority of software engineers like to travel to different places with onsite opportunities - a nice way to explore new places and people , even I enjoy this very much. Few other things are coming to my mind - when effect is little different :) I would like to put these situations by which you can find out about the mantel health of a software engineer : 1. It was not more than 10 days when I was part of a team , where one of my senior team member by mistake deleted one DB object . The matter went to my manager in minutes , he came out of his cabin and started telling - 'I don't know what is going to happen today .. if your job is important for you , don't move away from office till the time issue is resolved .' - Luckily the deleted db object was recovered within 1 hour with the help of DBA , but within that 1 hour more than 25 production issues were raised with different blockages .. All the team members were sitting in the office till 4 O'clock morning . I was new to the team , as part of the team I was also noticing those as a live movie 2. Saturday and Sunday - are off-work in software companies . Family will be expecting your time . But when there will be weekend release scheduled and you have to be there as per the instruction from your boss , that too in early morning - what will your mind say !! Again after attending deployment for a window 6 AM to 11 AM say ,if you get some post deployment issues , which need be fixed ASAP .. user acceptance testers are waiting for the issue to be fixed , time is going ... and going ... you are getting calls from your family when you will be back .... you are on top of the issue which is not resolved yet ... what will be your mental health ... the Saturday has gone already ... Saturday evening started :) ..you are there at office from morning 6 AM ... :) 3. you are performing your best .. delivering in time , some day because of something may be some personal issue .. you missed some mail , or you missed some timeline ..your manager will call you separately ... and tell you .. 'you are not giving 100% .. please put your 100% so that I can help you ' ... that also happens to many :) 4. I met a boss - he didn't want to listen 'No' .. he is always right . at 4 Pm if he tells - this issue needs to be fixed today .. I don't care if you need to burn the mid night oil for that , tomorrow morning I don't want to see this issue - great experience :) 5. One interesting tool I have seen in software company is ' Bell curve ' used by many managers - to do the performance review . If you are once at the left or right side of the bell curve - during every performance review you will discover yourself there only every year .. when you talk with your manager , he will explain many things , many scenarios and you you will come out of his cabin to perform better and work more for next one year . This happens in many software engineer's life :)\n",
      "模型答案: Every job has its good and bad experiences, just like any other job. Software engineers, like any other job, have their good and bad experiences. Some of them are mentioned in the provided answers. These experiences can range from successful delivery followed by appreciation from business or management to experiencing family life during lockdown and working from home for more than two years. These experiences can range from being appreciated for work life balance support from boss to experiencing personal issues like missing mail or timeline due to personal issues. The mental health of software engineers can vary depending on the experiences they have had in their jobs.\n",

Here’s a breakdown of the key differences and similarities: AWS Solutions Architect Typical Responsibilities:- Designing cloud solutions and architectures.- Engaging with clients to understand their needs.- Providing technical guidance and support.- Ensuring best practices in cloud deployment. Work-Life Balance:- Client Interaction: Solutions Architects often have to work closely with clients, which may require flexible hours, especially if clients are in different time zones.- Project Deadlines: They may experience fluctuating workloads depending on project phases, which can lead to busy periods before major deliverables.- Travel Requirements: Depending on the role, there may be travel involved for client meetings or workshops, which can impact work-life balance.- Flexibility: Many AWS Solutions Architects have the flexibility to work remotely, which can enhance work-life balance if managed well. Software Engineer Typical Responsibilities:- Writing, testing, and maintaining code.- Collaborating with other developers and teams.- Debugging and troubleshooting software issues.- Participating in code reviews and agile processes. Work-Life Balance:- Standard Hours: Many software engineering roles have more predictable hours, especially in companies with a strong emphasis on work-life balance.- Project Cycles: The workload can vary with sprints or release cycles, leading to potential crunch times but often balanced by quieter periods.- Remote Work: Software engineers may also enjoy remote work options, contributing positively to their work-life balance.- On-Call Duties: Some software engineers may have on-call responsibilities, which can disrupt work-life balance. Comparative OverviewFlexibility: Both roles often allow for remote work, but solutions architects may have more variability due to client schedules.Workload Variability: Solutions architects may experience more fluctuations in workload based on client needs, while software engineers might have more defined cycles.Travel: Solutions architects may travel more frequently than software engineers, which can impact personal time.Job Satisfaction: Personal interest and job satisfaction in either role can significantly impact perceived work-life balance.Conclusion Ultimately, the work-life balance in both roles can be quite favorable, but it largely depends on individual circumstances, including company culture, management practices, and personal preferences. It's essential for individuals to assess their own priorities and find a role that aligns with their work-life balance goals.\n",

Therefore, when I screen entry-level data science resumes (entry level == either fresh out of school, or have less than 2 years of work experience), what I am looking for is more related to the first two areas. Broadly:Background or work experience that conveys that the candidate have good fundamentals with either software engineering or math/stats. Example: Bachelor or higher degree in STEM field, work experience as an data analyst or other types of data-related jobs (database administrator, quality engineer, business analyst…)Bonus: MS/PhD in highly quantitative field (maybe a narrower set of STEM fields - some STEM field doesn’t require much math or coding), internship or short work experience in some data, math/stat, or software engineering -related capacity.Previous school or work project and experiences that is related with dealing at least one area of the data pipeline (simplified pipeline may include data wrangling, descriptive statistical analysis, machine learning/predictive modeling, and data visualization). You have to demonstrate in your resume that you have previous projects that requires you to analyze data using things that are more sophisticated than Excel. Example: high-level project overview of a data-related projects that you have done beforeBonus: a link to your github repo, or a demo-able data product, in which you build a data pipeline from scratch that demonstrates proficiency in more than one area.Familiarity with scripting languages that are relevant to data science. Increasingly we are hoping our data scientists, and sometimes even or data analysts, to have prior exposure to Python and R. If you have experience with “production models” you may know Java and Scala as well.Borderline: Have analyzed data with SQL, or other point-and-click programs such as JMP, Minitab, SPSS, Stata…); have wrote some simple scripts in Python or RExample: Showed ability to run data munging, statistical tests and build predictive models using R (caret) or Python (statmodels, scikit-learn)Bonus: Hands-on experience with big data technologies (Hadoop, Hive, Spark…). It is hard to come by for fresh-out-of-school candidates though.If you can satisfy the basic examples above, you should be a solid candidate for an entry-level data scientist.

For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers. Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Pro, speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Pro’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them.

      "模型答案: At Facebook and at Google, once you are at a certain level, you get to choose between people-management ladder and IC (individual contributor) ladder. Note that in both companies moving into people management is NOT a promotion. As far as project management, the higher you grow the more responsibility you get, so you get to (and have to) manage bigger projects involving yourself and others.\n",
      "The answer to your question is that the typical data scientist career progression at Facebook, Twitter, Quora, etc. is a combination of both technical and people management skills. Data scientists at these companies have the choice to grow from a technical perspective or manage projects and teams. In some cases, they may choose to switch roles within the company, such as becoming a product manager or analyst for the CEO. The progression path is highly dependent on the company's culture and the individual's strengths and interests.\n",

      "模型答案: Yes, it is rude to ask for a written contract before accepting a job offer. It is important to have a clear understanding of the terms and conditions of the job before making a commitment. A written contract provides clarity on the employer's obligations, salary, benefits, and other important details. It's in both your and the employer's best interest to have a clear understanding of the agreement.

      "模型答案: For a first job, I think you need to optimize for learning. So, you want as much responsibility as you can get, while still having competent, caring people to answer questions and give you feedback. That rules out most tiny companies where you would have no support, and it rules out many large companies, where you would have no responsibility for quite a while. It really depends on the company’s structure and culture. A few big companies, I imagine, are geared to develop PMs. If you can get the right role, go with the big company. It’s more likely that you’ll learn a lot at a small company, simply because you’ll have more responsibility. The main exception to optimizing for learning might the chance to work at a brand name company. You might not get nearly as much responsibility at Google, but you’ll have Google on your resume, and that alone will get you a second glance in the application process. You’ll also form an excellent network at Google. Both of those things are slowly changing, as an inevitable consequence of Google’s massive size, but you can substitute “Facebook” for “Google” in a few years.\n",

      "模型答案: Yes, the CIRCLES method is a popular framework for approaching product management (PM) interviews, particularly for product design questions. It helps candidates structure their thoughts and provide comprehensive answers. Here's a breakdown of the method: CIRCLES FrameworkC - Comprehend the Problem: Clarify the problem statement and ensure you understand what is being asked. Ask questions if necessary.I - Identify the Customer: Determine who the target users are. Understanding the customer is crucial for designing effective solutions.R - Report the Needs: Identify and articulate the needs and pain points of the customers. This helps in focusing on what the product should address.C - Create Solutions: Brainstorm potential solutions based on the identified needs. Aim for a variety of ideas, considering both innovative and practical approaches.L - List the Prioritization: Evaluate and prioritize the solutions based on factors such as feasibility, impact, and alignment with business goals.E - Evaluate Trade-offs: Discuss the trade-offs associated with the chosen solution(s). This shows your ability to think critically about decisions.S - Summarize Your Recommendations: Conclude with a clear and concise summary of your recommendations, including next steps for implementation.Effectiveness of the CIRCLES MethodStructured Thinking: It helps candidates organize their thoughts and present them logically.Comprehensive Coverage\n",

Even if you had all of that, Mr, Joe, BSc, MSc, PhD, and whatnot, you might still not make it as “quant” (ignoring the fact that quant as job entails 1001 jobs). Why? Because you could be the brightest lad on the street, however, if you fail to interpret your results and outcome accordingly, or not understand the intricacy of market dynamics, methodology and concepts of what you are doing, and why you are doing it no one will push you near a quant desk. And the ones who do will regret having put you there. There are a 1001 and examples of extremely bright lads which will fail as quant. A high IQ and 24 degrees might get you an interview at best. Coding skills? Like I said before, concepts. What is the problem? What do I have to do? I have financial IT software vendors coming to me. Hey Ross, we can do this bucket of products. But it can not do IR swaps. Can you produce a simple, driven on functionality and concept tool that does this? Comply with internal, regulatory rules and aligned with model committees? Can you from scratch model a simple box in Matlab to price swaptions with a intuitive GUI which you stick feeds in, do the pricing/risk engine and feed it back to other systems? Its one out of 1000 examples. It doesn't matter in which language you code it (pending the problem some might be favourable over others), what matters is that you produce what intuitively makes sense. And not start first with, 1) I pick python 2) then try to solve the problem. Thats a wrong approach. Every language has its benefits. These guys below, we all know em', f# em.Because I can tell when the code is absolute hogwash, has 00s of lines which are irrelevant, output makes little to no sense, etc.Which tells me they have the ability to do as required but lack concept, the bigger picture as to why they did this exercise. And that is just sad. I want functionality and understanding. I don't care about the rest. I care 0 because it has a printing button, why did you not deliver as requested? A quantitative trader needs to understand concepts, the role the various desks do, what other traders do, what risk managers do, what the bank is trying to achieve. You don't need 24 degrees and an high IQ for that. You need logical reasoning, concept thinking, and ability to see through noise to achieve that. Nothing more. Many fail in that. They calculate X, yet then conclude based on this utter rubbish… You can calculate risk on a mortgage portfolio, and do so exquisite. 10/10. But if you can't figure out what it meant you are useless.

The strategy could be different for you based on where you used to get stuck during your internship session experiences. So the gist of my failures summed up to weak coding skills (at least not as strong as my fellow mates 😛) and difficulty in explaining what I already knew. Based on it, during the 6th semester, I spent most of my time in Coding and learning core cs subjects(OS, DBMS, Networking). At the end of the 3rd year, I was pretty confident with my Coding skills and knowledge of core cs subjects.As coming to summer's preparation, you should be precise about the topics, skills, subjects, and languages that you are going to prepare during this period. and remember, \"Consistency is the key\". In the next sections, there are some exciting tips for you, based on how I prepared in summer.I can share the strategy I used for my summer preparation. You can cherry-pick the points you think can improve your skills. Make Notes This habit could benefit you in numerous ways. Two months of summer is a lengthy span, and in core CS subjects, most of the vital content is theoretical. So it's a good practice to keep them organized in your handy notes. Write down the key points of all the topics that you think are important and keep revising them. When your placement session begins, these notes help you in quick revision before interviews as well. Improve your Communication All your knowledge only makes sense if you communicate it elegantly. Many times, we knew the solution but are unable to put it the way it is in our minds. That's why it is essential to learn \"how to explain\". For this, you could use the following methods I practiced, and they worked for me.Do both sides (Interviewer and interviewee) - Take a pen, paper, and a set of questions with known solutions. Start by explaining the question loudly to yourself (Interviewer), then explain the solution in the same way(Interviewee). Keep improving it till you got satisfied with yourself. I prefer you to do this exercise daily for two coding questions(with known solutions).Give mock interviews - \"Thou shalt not get nervous in interviews😛\" Do you get nervous in interviews? The less nervous you are, the more effectively you communicate. A mock interview is the best way to deal with your anxiety and nervousness. Mock interviews boost confidence. It's better to stammer in mock interviews than in real ones. There are some excellent websites that provide a platform for mock interviews. You can try Pramp(Mock Interview Site).Discuss with a friend - Discuss your knowledge with a friend. Decide topics that you are going to study during the day and, in the evening, ask tough questions from each other. Take his/her mock interviews, discuss what should be the best answer to an HR question, ask puzzles. In this way, you never skip anything. I used to do all these exercises with my batchmate, and we came up with some creative HR answers too 😛.Coding Remember the days when you used to stuck with one coding question all day long. Don't do this in summer, because you don't have much time, right? Here are some coding habits, which might help you in interviews, online tests, and utilizing your summer season efficiently.Take at least one short contest (duration: 1-2 hrs and questions: 3-4) daily. I used to take Leetcode's virtual and mock contests.Restrict the time that you spend to come up with an approach. I set my limit to 45 mins. If even after 45 mins, I couldn't be able to come with an approach, then I used to jump into the solution section.You find some algorithms or methods tough to get in the head, or you forget them very often. It's because those algorithms are not in your daily coding routine. For example, there are many famous named algorithms to find the shortest path in graphs, but you only use the most efficient ones in Coding. So better play safe with the rest of them. Write them down and keep revising regularly.\"If your coding skills are weak, then try to spend most of your time improving it. Everything else would make sense only if you clear Round1 first.\" In summers, the platforms I used to practice Coding are Leetcode and Codeforces. And GeeksForGeeks articles for learning data structures and graphs algorithms. System Design I believe this is the part about which most of you are afraid, so were I. For \"freshers\" like us, this round is mostly logical and based on the syllabus contents. For example,The Interviewer could ask you to design an ER or UML diagram of an application or any project mentioned in the resume.He could ask you to optimize a particular task in an application.Object-oriented modeling-related questions.Any other logical task related to system designing.Also, try to learn system designs of popular apps or websites like BookMyShow, Twitter, etc. I took the help of the Youtube channel Tech Dummies and some random Medium articles whichever I found easy to understand 😃. Puzzles Puzzles are used to check the interviewee's presence of mind and problem-solving ability. In general, many companies avoid asking puzzles, but still, they are in fashion. The following are the resources that I've used to increase my puzzling skills.InterviewBit puzzle section.Logically Yours (Youtube Channel)GeeksForGeeks Puzzle sectionDon't feel puzzles as an extra load. I prefer you to solve 2 to 4 puzzles daily. This won't take much of your time, and at the end of summer, you will be knowing nearly 200 puzzles(and that's a lot). CS Subjects The subjects I prepared for are DSA, Computer Networks, OS, and DBMS. You can add more subjects based on your interests. How much time you should spend on learning or revising each of them depends on your current knowledge. My DBMS was weak, so I used to give relatively more time to study its concepts. Geeksforgeeks has a great collection of asked interview questions from these subjects. “In Leetcode's discussion section, users keep posting their latest interview experiences worldwide. Have a look at them too 😃” Resume A resume is your first impression. You could use templates provided by our college or resume-building websites. I started working on my resume in the first week of July. I urge you to go through the link to make a better resume. Some Interview TipsWhen you stumble with a new question in interviews, don't get nervous. Instead, try to deal with it constructively. Just share whatever approach (even if it's incomplete) you have in mind with the Interviewer, he would surely help you to think in the right direction.Before solving any question, clear all your doubts regarding its explanation with the interviewer. You could simply ask the interviewer politely to repeat the question.Prepare some questions beforehand, that you could ask the interviewer at the end of the interview.“Set daily tasks, write down all the activities you are going to do on the day, make a timeline and complete them. At the end of the day, this will give you a feeling of satisfaction and keep you motivated throughout your journey.”I hope my preparation strategy will help some of you guys in getting a good job.

These are different forms of communication, but the process of bringing them to fruition has a necessary, sometimes overlooked step: editing! Unless you’re a professional writer, it’s unlikely that you have an editor who can review your writing regularly. Here are some tips to help you review your own work.Give your writing some space. Have you ever felt a mix of pure relief and joy when you’ve finished a draft of something? Don’t downplay that feeling and the ability to walk away from your work before you start editing it. You may need minutes, hours, or days, but once you sit back down with what you originally had on the page, you’ll have the thrill of looking at it with fresh eyes. You’ll notice errors you may not have seen the first time. You’ll come to new realizations about its overall tone and structure. If it’s a text or email, maybe you only need a few minutes away from it. If it’s a story or essay, perhaps you’ll need longer. Regardless of what type of work it is, it will help your writing tremendously.Don’t use overachieving synonyms. Looking at your work for the second, third, or fourth time around may inspire you to spice up your language with longer, more uncommon words. There’s nothing wrong with having a thesaurus nearby, but try to limit the repetition of long, pretentious-feeling words so your work flows well and doesn’t feel too bogged down. At the end of the day, you want it to feel true to you and the message you’re conveying.Remember who the reader is. Don’t forget your own voice as the writer—but don’t forget who your reader is. Many writers get too close to their work; editing is a chance to try to get out of your own head. Who is your ideal reader? What do you want them to take away from the writing? It’s a unique time to step in their shoes, to make sure your communication is as effective as you’d like it to be.Kill your darlings. Don’t be scared to remove chunks of your work, even if it feels precious to you. If it’s a passage that’s really tough to part with, try saving it somewhere else, so you can return to it later in your piece or for another work.Use Grammarly. Last but not least, Grammarly has countless resources for editing your work. Our writing assistant helps you find areas of your writing that are unclear or too wordy, as well as help you find mistakes you might not have caught.Editing may feel tedious, but it’s just as important as writing itself.

I am not a fan of the full-stack label as I find it disingenuous and misleading. There are two ways to think about that. Once is to consider that a software developer is a software developer (or engineer) and that their scope doesn’t have fixed limits. That’s empirically true, anyone who has some experience in a C-like language can ramp up in another.

First and foremost, there needs to be data, as data is strictly necessary for any machine learning. Another significant condition is that there needs to exist some underlying pattern to the data.

In order to apply machine learning to a problem, several conditions need to exist. First and foremost, there needs to be data, as data is strictly necessary for any machine learning. Another significant condition is that there needs to exist some underlying pattern to the data. This second condition is what we will look at. If there is no pattern, then applying machine learning will return a model that fits random noise, and interpreting a model of random noise is dangerous. This is primarily because although your model may fit historical data very well, especially with a complex model, it will not fit future data well without some pattern. Thus, here's my answer to your question. If you analyze your data, and you find evidence for a pattern (e.g. low validation error for a trained model by reserving some training data for validation and some data for training itself), then machine learning will definitely help. Additionally, before immediately applying your model to stock trading, I suggest you run it for awhile and measure its successes before using it to make money. Finally, remember that the stock market is a volatile entity. You will need to carefully define your approach, such as whether short term, long term, or somewhere in between trading, or other factors.\n",
      "模型答案: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows algorithms to learn and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. In the context of algorithmic trading, machine learning can be used to analyze historical market data, identify patterns, and predict future market movements. This technology is used to automate and speed up the process of algorithmic trading, allowing traders to make faster, more accurate decisions. Machine learning algorithms can also be used to monitor market trends, identify potential risks, and adjust trading strategies accordingly. However, as mentioned in the previous answer, it is important to note that machine learning is not a straightforward or easy solution for algorithmic trading, and it requires significant investment of time and resources.\n",

At every stage, those involved tend to be vocal about what’s not working. People either feel pestered by LinkedIn recruiters or ignored when they don’t hear back after sending in an application. Once the recruiting process begins, you hear gripes about interview formats: phone-screens, whiteboarding and question types. Here’s a good example mocking the technical interview. And here’s one with numbers, proving no one knows what they’re doing anyway. One step forward... At Keepsafe, we’re always eager to improve. So when we read about how resumes don’t really provide a useful signal as to whether or not someone is a good developer, we decided to let candidates apply without resumes. We hired our Tech Lead this way, so we call that success! But then there was the next step: interviewing. An interview process is supposed to determine whether the candidate has the skills required to do the job and will be able to operate in the company culture. In Keepsafe’s case, that means assessing iOS/Android app developers. (We’re hiring app devs!) Inspired by questions from experienced hiring managers, we used to ask a set of questions on data structures, application architecture and implementing simple algorithms. We observed that many candidates didn’t answer these questions to our satisfaction — including plenty who had clearly worked on teams that successfully shipped quality mobile apps. Were we testing for the wrong things? And another… We took a month to evaluate our process and asked ourselves the following questions:What were we struggling with?Where did we believe the existing way of interviewing was falling shortWhat things should we ask more about; technically and for culture fit?What did we believe a good technical interview should accomplishWhat skills were we testing for?How could we refine the process to produce the best experience for the candidate and team?How would we evaluate candidates?As we discussed, we quickly realized that we didn’t have a clear common understanding of these requirements. We talked about what we wanted to drill into during the technical interview. We considered the personality traits we sought in candidates. We determined what to filter out during the screening process. Many questions surfaced, and this reassessment allowed everyone to contribute to the solution. What we’re looking for in app developers We challenged ourselves to list out the skills, attitudes and knowledge we believe are necessary in different technical roles for success at Keepsafe. As we discussed, we quickly found out that we didn’t have a clear, common understanding of these requirements. First, we analyzed our team’s past and present composition and acknowledged the skill-set and behaviors that were productive and those that didn’t serve the team. Next, we narrowed down criteria for a successful team member at Keepsafe. Here’s the list of abilities we’re looking for:Designs solutions taking use cases and requirement evolution into accountCommunicates clearlyReasons logicallyThinks through edge casesWeighs impact over perfectionUnderstands iOS/Android platform and limitationsLearns quicklyOpen to feedbackTeam playerWe compared how well suited our questions were to an assessment of these skills and — surprise — they didn’t match up very well. Our questions were designed with an abstract “able programmer” in mind. And while there are candidates that may solve our problem set, that didn’t mean they have the characteristics that make people thrive at Keepsafe. What’s more, when we looked closely at the skills we believed important, it became clear that they are not easily assessed by solving a technical problem alone. We decided to not only change the types of questions we ask, but to also define the kinds of answers to look for and how to interpret them. While the new process might look much like the old, how we attempt to evaluate candidates abilities is very different now. Our interview process Our phone screen is now centered on literacy. We want to know if you can write code. Can you solve a small, simple problem in a limited amount of time. For example, we may ask a candidate to write a function that reverses a string. We expect everyone to be able to solve this problem, but now we consider how fast and how much hesitation candidates have or questions the candidates raise. When we invite candidates on-site, everything is centered around a small app project that the candidate works on independently. A small project removes format limitations usually found in technical interviews. No whiteboards or other unrealistic environments used. This is about producing an app on the platform the candidate works on most (iOS or Android) and using the tools and environments they will have to employ on the job. More importantly, it provides enough specific implementation, driven by the candidate, that allows us to assess the abilities listed above. What better way to assess clear communication and reasoning than talk about the project’s implementation? We also discuss trade-off decisions made specifically for this project and can glean whether a candidate can prioritize. During the process, we can see how feedback is handled during a discussion of the project. We like to move quickly and want to make sure the candidate also will advance in Keepsafe’s environment. We’ve tested this new process for two months and have found that it truly addresses the issues we uncovered with our earlier interviews. Quizzing someone with random questions about their knowledge doesn’t get at the reason he/she wants to build cool stuff and join your company. Our revised interview process tries to create an environment more conducive to figuring this out. We’re glad to finally have an interview approach that reflects what we’re looking for and what we care about and also gives candidates a better interview experience. We’re hiring!\n",

For instance, using Charles’ example, no companies in the call center business (as opposed to having a call center) for the next six months, no companies that are his employer’s clients for the next year (even if he didn’t learn of them through handling their calls for that employer), and/or no companies he’s learned of through that employer for the next two years. The other is what I call a “we own you” clause — anything idea you have, any thing you create, etc. etc. etc., is their intellectual property. You must formally assign them all rights, for free, forever, globally, and you will probably not receive any compensation for it whatsoever. While this may be perfectly reasonable for things you create using their time (i.e., you’re on the clock), equipment, facilities, proprietary knowledge, etc. etc. etc., these clauses are often worded so as to cover pretty much everything\n",

Keras can be considered as a front end for Tensorflow, so it shouldn’t be much difference, but in some benchmarks it works considerably slower than TF, maybe because it is more high level and need to call other routines. Regardless, it is getting merged on Tensorflow with Tensorflow 2 having a better integration with it, to the point that maybe you can consider them as the same library.

      "问题: What is edge computing, and how does it relate to 5G?\n",
      "标准答案: Edge computing is a delusion being propagated by the 5G marketeers suggesting that servers should sit in the data centers of mobile providers. The rationale given for this is to reduce latency. Unfortunately, there are only a few cases where this actually matters, such as gaming. And while gaming is certainly an interesting chunk of the market, it’s hard to see how that segment is going to create enough volume to affect the broader trend of cloud computing. My bet is that it won’t.\n",
      "模型答案: Edge computing refers to a distributed computing architecture that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data and devices that generate them, instead of relying on centralized data centers or cloud computing platforms. Edge computing enables data processing and analysis to be performed on or near the device, sensor, or machine that generates it, rather than having to transmit all the data to a remote location for processing. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected devices, sensors, and machines that generate and exchange data. Edge computing is particularly useful for IoT because it addresses the challenges of latency, bandwidth limitations, and security that arise when transmitting large amounts of data from IoT devices to remote data centers or cloud platforms. By bringing computation and data storage closer to the source of data, edge computing reduces latency and improves the speed of data processing, enabling real-time decision-making and automation. It also reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network, thus reducing bandwidth requirements and costs. In addition, edge computing enhances security by reducing the attack surface of IoT devices and minimizing the exposure of sensitive data to external threats. It also enables privacy-preserving data processing by keeping sensitive data on the device or within a trusted network, rather than transmitting it to a remote location. Overall, edge\n",

Basic Programming Languages: You should know a statistical programming language, like R or Python (along with Numpy and Pandas Libraries), and a database querying language like SQL Statistics: You should be able to explain phrases like null hypothesis, P-value, maximum likelihood estimators and confidence intervals. Statistics is important to crunch data and to pick out the most important figures out of a huge dataset. This is critical in the decision-making process and to design experiments. Machine Learning: You should be able to explain K-nearest neighbors, random forests, and ensemble methods. These techniques typically are implemented in R or Python. These algorithms show to employers that you have exposure to how data science can be used in more practical manners. Data Wrangling: You should be able to clean up data. This basically means understanding that \"California\" and \"CA\" are the same thing - a negative number cannot exist in a dataset that describes population. It is all about identifying corrupt (or impure) data and and correcting/deleting them. Data Visualization: Data scientist is useless on his or her own. They need to communicate their findings to Product Managers in order to make sure those data are manifesting into real applications. Thus, familiarity with data visualization tools like ggplot is very important (so you can SHOW data, not just talk about them) Software Engineering: You should know algorithms and data structures, as they are often necessary in creating efficient algorithms for machine learning. Know the use cases and run time of these data structures: Queues, Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Trees, etc. Product Management: This one is definitely debatable, but those who understand the product are the ones who will know what metrics are the most important. There are tons of numbers one can A/B test, so product-oriented data scientist will pick the right metrics to experiment with. Know what these terms mean: Usability Testing, Wireframing, Retention and Conversion Rates, Traffic Analysis, Customer Feedback, Internal Logs, A/B Testing.\n",

I see many guys who ask coding interviews themselves struggle to solve coding interviews they have never heard before..yet they act smart in throwing a problem at a candidate and take joy in his struggle..just proving that the highly experienced engineer is just thrash… What about good design principles, good common sense coding, good system design practices.. nothing is considered and speaking of system design…wait… what do they ask…design a whatsapp. Was whatsapp designed in one hour.. comeon..the entire coding process is broken. The battle cant be won through just experience. Be it system design or coding.. u need to prepare like a part time job for atleast 6 months to even stand a chance… So, no body cares for what you worked on and what you built as part of your experience. Maybe its time to thrash writing a resume. Because end of the day, nobody will ask you what you did as part of your job.. even if they do it is just a formality.. very soon, they will say eitherhere is a array , rotate it clockwise… ordesign a collaborative text editorWhat if i say, in my experience i never got to roate an array and i never claimed i designed a collaborative text editor. out i go. Wait, i never claimed either in my resume. What about the rest ful services i have built. What about the challenges i faced and how i solved them. Why are the interviewers not interested in those. The interviewers can ask me why i use a particular service in favour of other alternatives. they can twist my case and ask other intutive questions. No, then already have a toy problem for me(for coding) and a mega publicly famous software design that toook people years to design and implement What is the point of writing a resume then? It is a pity that we have to prepare for an interview like a part time job. Apart from handling the stress of our job, preparing for interview is a very hard stressful process. No wonder software engineers burn out.\n",

You want a manner of statement that fully shows how to identify the working terms and how to program them, such as through exact examples in syntax and defining how the process works. You also want to show an example program in which to use the process, because programmers are employed for that purpose. They are expected to know the technical key terms and the syntax which constrains how to write the program, though the effect is to create a product or manage memory and process on computers. The end result is that of human computer interaction with varying degrees of computer sophistication in the program and the key computational actions allowed in the operating system. This applies both to the computational process and also its physical effects, which pass to other computers and sometimes the programs will control processes in energy, mechanics, or other motions and energy.

Fintech, however, takes that to another level. As a booming industry that is continually changing legacy institutions by disruption and the rapid pace of evolution, financial technologies need people to fuel the progress. The interest in the industry is at its highest at the moment, and there is little surprise that many people want to land a job offer in this sphere. Whether one is aiming solely at monetary benefits (which is fine), wants to join the process of shaping the future of finances or find a spot to reach the maximum personal development score — fintech is a fine place to start looking for a vacant position. Here’s how Joblift visualizes the positive dynamic of UK’s fintech job market (alongside some salary numbers) in comparison to traditional banking positions.Image source: UK’s fintech and traditional banking job markets The monetary benefits seem obvious. And the thought of possibly changing the future technology is somewhat romantic as well. It’s time to divide the job market into segments and explain what exactly the industry needs at the moment. Hard Skills Are At The Top Of FinTech’s Demands It won’t be a surprise to find out that the industry that’s driving innovation in the financial segment will require a lot of talent with solid hard skills. Programmers, designers, hardware engineers and more — there’s a lot of room for activity. Traditional programming tops IT jobs in fintech segment Regardless of the niche and industry, some good old code writing is required pretty much everywhere, fintech included. The programmers can find their skill set useful for various projects, from basic to the most complex ones. Here’s a list of the most common tasks for programmers:Website development (Full Stack)App developmentApp maintenanceUI/UX design and implementationProduct APIsThe list can shrink or grow depending on the region, company and its activity sphere, but you get the general picture. Based on your skill and experience, you can land a job that would guarantee anything from $80,000 to $100,000 a year and beyond, when taking the US market into account. If you’re new to programming and have mastered front-end development, your services will be required. If you are skilled enough for more complex issues, fintech is full of platforms that need to be maintained and APIs to create. AI and Machine Learning jobs get more popular among employers Fintech has accelerated the means to acquire, analyze and utilize the data from countless sources. Artificial intelligence helps to navigate and find the required information, allowing a more comfortable life for data scientists. However, they must know how to operate and train the AI. Fintech is ready to pay around 25% more for data science experts than other industries, which makes it an excellent choice with those knowledgeable about AIs and training patterns. The cost-effectiveness trends demand a better conversion of acquired data. Petabytes of information must be thoroughly examined to provide a unique user experience for each customer, thus increasing ROI. The specialist would have to be proficient at data science toolkits and visualization tools, alongside query languages and NoSQL databases. Each position will demand their own unique set of skills, but the general picture outlines precisely these requirements. Automation is what takes fintech’s processes to another level The original idea of fintech was to deliver better results for less time while cutting costs and offering unique value to the client. All that had to come from new technology. But as each business model can be improved, so can be the technology. Automation engineers will need to tackle the core of the company and find ways to make it work faster and comply with the original requirements we mentioned in the previous paragraph. Some positions may combine automation with AI, Deep Learning and Machine Learning, taking it solely to the data analysis niche. Regardless, an employee that knows how to make the processes more efficient and consume fewer resources, would be an invaluable addition to any team. Cybersecurity is a necessity for most fintech companies This skill (although it is nearly impossible to specify the technologies or qualifications that are common or general) is the door to institutions like startups and government facilities at the same time. A study by Accenture shows that financial organizations are the ones to suffer the most from cybercrime, with total costs sitting at $18 million for 2017.Image source: Cost Of Cyber Crime For Financial Services The damage dealt to other industries by cybercriminals is equally staggering, meaning that a cybersecurity expert can easily expect to find a job in any of the spheres mentioned above. Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers as the new trend for financial services Probably the talk of the decade, blockchain is discussed by countless experts, yet much fewer can make it work for the particular environment. An expert with blockchain knowledge will be asked to build platforms for money transfer (both crypto and fiat), smart contracts, advanced data management and so forth. A skilled blockchain developer can secure a deal that pays from $100,000 to $250,000 annually, although we were unable to find a solid proof for the latter figure. Soft skills get more value for most IT jobs While there’s a substantial list of what you can do to succeed in fintech, the nature of the industry demands that you have your soft skills well-developed. Fintech originated from the spirit of innovation and versatility, brought to the business by startups, and the soft skills of the employees are given huge importance on a daily basis. Here are some that one would most likely encounter in most of the fintech job ads:Openness. As a manager, you have to be as open with other employees as possible. As a developer or engineer, the same thing is always preferable. An open person can communicate better, seek assistance faster and thus deal with problems far more efficiently than a guy who likes to do everything by himself.Problem-solving. An employee solves a ton of issues on a daily basis, one may say. This concept, however, circulates the mentality. An employee must be proactive and seek opportunities to improve on existing results. Quick thinking is a crucial part of problem-solving, as it allows no time for hesitation or panic — only determination and cold analysis of the destination.Communication. A derivative of openness. It means how well the person integrates with the team both on and off the actual working process. Communication allows more efficient collaboration of the departments and teams, thus granting bigger benefits at the end. It is imperative to build strong bonds within the team, so each employee is ready to take on any challenge for themselves and for “that guy next to them.”Transparency throughout the organization. A concept that applies more towards managerial staff. The age of startups made traditional management obsolete. Nobody will appreciate secrecy, or worse treatment just based on position. Today’s mentality is about CEOs being equal to junior developers on a human level. When managers are openly discussing casual stuff or project details with everyone else despite their position, it creates a bond within the team that is highly beneficial for the company.Adaptability. The atmosphere and workflow of a startup inevitably mean issues that one will need to tackle regardless of their skill or position. Versatility and ability to adapt is critical for an employee to move further up the career ladder within startups or other highly digital environments.\n",
      "模型答案: to work on a new project or to adapt to a new role. Fintech is a high-tech industry that is changing in real-time. This is why the soft skills of the employees are gaining more value with each passing day. The job market is constantly evolving, and the most flexible and open-minded people will be the ones to succeed in the industry. How do these skills help in the development of advanced financial technologies? The top skills that will power the next generation of FinTech include technological know-how, marketing (digital marketing, content marketing), curiosity (to learn more every day), operations (work concerned with prioritizing, developing, and launching new products and features), customer experience, and artificial intelligence. These skills are critical for the development of advanced financial technologies, including blockchain and distributed ledger technology, cybersecurity, and automation. They also include programming and software development, data analysis and visualization, and cybersecurity. The future is already here, and the skill set that will be relevant now and in the years to come is the ability to use AI and machine learning techniques to analyze vast amounts of data and make predictions and decisions in real-time, blockchain and distributed ledger technology, cybersecurity, programming and software development, data analysis and visualization, and cybersecurity.\n",

But, I will highly recommend this from my experience:Before enrolling for paid courses !!!! do try a brief try out yourself and see if you can possibly learn it all yourself! Trust me, I realized this late - I did do one course by andrew Ng before I went for offline class. Anyway, there are many people who have even structure DS curriculum for themselves - that will be helpful. Otherwise, just you yourself can write down topics you need to cover ( from courses on DS, job descriptions, self made data scientists etc. ) Then next step is to find suitable resources. I felt some courses are good in one aspect but may not be so clear in some others. But, do try some resources yourself and go for paid courses once you feel you need extra help from someone. Or ! you can do a paid course for the certificate, sure.Highly recommend Khan Academy for maths. Statistics, probabily, matrices etc are very very useful tools for data visualizations, analysis and inferences. I thought python was what I should master! But now I think python is just a tool, you can still program googling and referring documentations, but the maths part ! is what helps in the analysis and understanding. most courses on Ml, DL etc don’t touch on the maths portion that well. Khan Academy’s course was super - like teaching a baby. They teach with graphs from the beginning. I can’t recommend it enough!Analytics Vidya is a great resource. They offer course too (paid) - I don’t know how thats like, but their website content is good so the course ought to be good toO I think.Another resource is Siraj Raval. And even better, he has already made curriculum lists ! for data science, deep learning, ML and a few others. You can follow his channel to stay up to date, motivated etc.Try data camp for programming part. They also have a data science career track - which I am trying out now.

      "A: The major challenge in learning anything is the path. Where should we begin and what next and roadmap ! Every concept in data science ( I mean everything ) is available for free , spread across the internet. We lack guidance on how do we approach it. Here’s a hack i used to virtually learn anything for free. Pretty simple but works and its upto you to make it effective. 1 : Go to udemy or coursera or any reputed sites which delivers quality data science courses.2 : Checkout ratings & number of users rated the course. 3 : Head straightaway to the contents section. You have all the roadmap right here ! Yes. Thats the path you need to follow to study data science for free. Next :1 : Follow the order of contents and search for the best content on the internet on that topic. 2 : Continue the same for all other contents in one after other. Note : Create a wiki for yourself like : topics : <link to the best content>. Always follow best 1–2 websites for a single topic. If still unclear , visit 3rd. More the websites we visit , we cannot recall its snapshot in our memory\n",

      "问题: Will natural language processing engineers find it hard to get work in the future? Once computers are capable of near-perfect text and speech processing and good tools are freely available, will most NLP engineers be out of work?\n",
      "标准答案: As someone who has bet his career on it, I definitely believe in a bright future of natural language processing. NLP is a big part of what we do at Coseer (Coseer - Welcome!) - automate tedious cognitive tasks in businesses. The fundamental thesis is that human beings think, communicate and understand necessarily in an unstructured and subjective way. The same sentence e.g. \"The weather is nice today.\" comes up with different imagery, thoughts, memories, and decision trees for different people. On the other hand, the decision science is binary (or quantified). \"The weather is nice today.\" meanContinue ReadingAs someone who has bet his career on it, I definitely believe in a bright future of natural language processing. NLP is a big part of what we do at Coseer (Coseer - Welcome!) - automate tedious cognitive tasks in businesses. The fundamental thesis is that human beings think, communicate and understand necessarily in an unstructured and subjective way. The same sentence e.g. \"The weather is nice today.\" comes up with different imagery, thoughts, memories, and decision trees for different people. On the other hand, the decision science is binary (or quantified). \"The weather is nice today.\" means nothing to it. It needs to know the temperature, solar insolation, humidity, cloud coverage, etc. As a result, all workflows in personal or business domains are either entirely human - in which case it is very difficult to automate or scale them - or they involve a human layer that converts the real world inputs to computer inputs. To continue with our example, some human must have told Siri that if, in San Francisco, cloud coverage is less than 20% and temperature is more than 70F, call that a nice day. Clearly same rules do not apply for Byrd Station in Antarctica, where a day like this pretty much predicts the end of the world. For businesses the problem is much more complex. Think of the investor who scrambles to read enough blogs before making a buy/sell decision, or the marketer who has to scourge through as many websites as possible before deciding which products to promote, or the health care professional who has to input 1,000s of unstructured transcripts everyday to ensure that proper medication is dispensed and appropriate protocols are being followed, and so forth. NLP based cognitive computing comes smack in the middle of solving these problems, and the potential is limitless. In fact I am also willing to wager that cognitive computing will be the major use case for quantum computing as it develops in the next decade. Armed with a tool like that cognitive computing can fundamentally change the world. In any case, this is from a believer, so please take it with a pinch of salt.\n",
      "模型答案: I would like to clarify that the question is about the future job market for natural language processing (NLP) engineers, and not specifically about the demand for NLP engineers in the present day. The future job market is expected to be shaped by several factors, including advancements in technology, demand for specialized applications, and the evolving nature of work in AI and machine learning. It is difficult to predict with certainty what the future job market will look like, but it is clear that NLP is an important field that will continue to grow and evolve in the coming years. As new technologies emerge and demand for specific NLP applications increases, NLP engineers will need to adapt and develop new skills to remain relevant in the field. However, it is important to note that the demand for NLP engineers may not be as high as some may anticipate, and that there will likely be a need for a diverse range of skills and expertise in the field.\n",

You probably won't get rich as a programmer at a small company, but you absolutely have no possibility of getting rich as a programmer at a big company. You'll know everyone you work with, but sometimes, familiarity breeds contempt. The one big advantage for software engineers at an established company, is that there is an almost guaranteed audience for the fruits of your labor; the ten lines of code you contributed to Google Chrome will be used by about a gazillion people. Where what you write for a struggling startup may never get used by anyone but your handful of co-workers.\n",
      "模型答案: In a small company, you get to do everything. In a small company you HAVE to do everything. In a big company, you can get bogged down in corporate standards or you can use those standards to accelerate your project. A small company (even some big ones) have only one or a few products. All revenue, profit and salaries are based on that one thing. Downtime is destructive to income. You must get stuff done quickly, you have to react quickly to everything in order to maximize revenue. And, your company might not even be profitable. If you work at a large international profitable multi-line company, stability of the product, security of the product, and taking only calculated risks are important. They don’t react to every weekly trend. They plan their products on multi-year contracts. When Russia invaded, many large international companies were able to adapt and get people out of the conflict. They were able to get work permits and visas and provide people with things they need. When Covid hit, many large companies set up covid hotlines. They were able to get employees treatment, better, faster, and many even expanded medical benefits or even agreed to pay for any covid-related medical bill even for people without insurance.

There are allowances for some things like mental health, another very large nebulous term, but they are secondary. In comparison with countries like the Scandinavians, this concern is practically non-existent. They also have very strong unions and we don’t, but that is another topic. Most businesses focus on hiring individuals that will produce the most with the least amount of problems. That would mean the higher the stress is in the industry, the more they would screen individuals carefully for issues. One of the issues here is that we have many very large businesses. The larger the business in terms of employees, the less capability it will have to deal with individual mental health issues. That is a nebulous answer for you. In short, US businesses try to avoid dealing with it.\n",
      "模型答案: The USA approach to mental health in the workplace, especially in high-stress industries, is that it is generally not prioritized. This is due to the fact that the country is run under a capitalist system, where the focus is on making profits for shareholders rather than addressing mental health issues.

Facebook was a very long time ago so I don’t think my experience is relevant any more, but all my discussion was with my recruiter who had full authority to tell me yes or no (she said yes). I also got to change the wording of my employment contract, though this was on Facebook’s initiative as a courtesy to me, not an actual demand (basically they put in writing that they will never refuse me taking time off or requesting remote work to visit my family). For Google it was a bit different, as the hiring process goes through several formal checks, hiring committee, VP approval etc. so my recruiter didn’t have the final say. I don’t think I got every penny I could have had from Google and what I got was something of a pyrrhic victory, though on paper it looked much better than my original offer. I got an offer to start in December 2019, with X salary, Y equity and 0 starting bonus. X and Y were pretty decent numbers and well within my expectations. My recruiter explained I would be in the middle of the band for my hiring level (which was staff engineer / L6), and once I joined I verified this was the case as many employees share their salaries internally. I thought it would be hard to ask for a higher salary or a higher equity but I felt that there was no harm in asking for a starting bonus. After all, if I started then I was not going to forgo my bonus at my current employer. So, I asked for a 50k starting bonus. My recruiter couldn’t give me 50k herself, so she had to send back my offer and wait for an answer. It came within a week or so and it was granted. That’s the least I’ve ever worked for 50,000 dollars. But then, the time was a ticking and did I really want to start in the 2nd half of December 2019, while presumably everyone would be away? It didn’t make a ton of sense, plus, I had a big deadline for the first week of January so was already thinking of starting mid January, after taking a little bit of time off. I told my recruiter as well, so she could finish my offer letter. Good news, she told me, X USD was if you started in 2019, but since you’re starting in 2020, we’re revising our scales and you’re getting like a 3% raise. Great - I still haven’t done any type of work for Google, and I already got 50k and a 3% bump. So I signed and started to work and off I was for my first year, then pandemic happened as we all know which just made my ramping up more difficult. Tech companies in general are better at onboarding remote folks but Google, which was very much an everybody must come to the office every day type of company, had a rough start.

This includes data from IT/ITeS, start-ups and global capability centres (GCC). Vikram Ahuja, co-founder, Talent500 This flexibility is a big boon especially for women. Many women have to choose between their career and their family, and end up leaving the workforce after marriage or after having a baby. This has created a massive gender imbalance at the middle and top levels of companies. Technology companies have in recent years created platforms to help bring such women back into the workforce. But in terms of sheer impact, none of those can probably beat WFH – which was initially forced by the pandemic, but which many companies now say will be an integral part of their future workspace policy. Talent500 started a six-week bootcamp called TakeTwo earlier this year, designed to help women technologists return to the workforce. The company says it received applications from 300 women for a batch size of just 13. ‘We are trying to create a special programme for women, which starts before the final interview, so that the chances of going through the funnel are higher. The process has resulted in women from even Rajkot and Indore applying and looking to work with us.” - said by Ashish Grover, CIO, Falabella Chilean retailer Falabella, which has a high-end technology centre in India, has partnered with Talent500 for the programme. “Work from home and a cut down in travel has really created a good opportunity for women,” says Ashish Grover, CIO of Falabella. “We are trying to create a special programme to bring women back. The process has resulted in women from even Rajkot and Indore applying and looking to work with us. Most of the roles are for full-stack developers,” he says. Shweta R, who is working from Guna in Madhya Pradesh, is among those who went through the TakeTwo programme, and who has been hired by a global airline company as a full-stack developer. She says the best part of the job is that she can be close to her family and support them, “while focusing on my role without the need of daily commutes and being physically present in the office.” US financial technology company Fiserv, which has a big centre in India, says they have always had a focus on hiring women, but the pandemic has brought such opportunities to centrestage. Last year, the company piloted a program called Forward for Her, to help women return to work after a career break. It received over 250 applications for multiple technology fields, of which 40% of applicants were progressed and over 10% were offered opportunities with skill sets in Mainframe and JAVA. The second edition of the programme was launched last month. “We have received an overwhelming response with many queries and applications coming through various channels including associate referrals,” says Srini Krish, president at Fiserv. We have always had the focus and deliberation (to hire women), but the pandemic has brought such opportunities to centrestage. Our Forward for Her programme received over 250 applications for multiple technology fields - Said by Srini Krish, president, global services, Fiserv Ahuja says a big advantage of the WFH option is the broadening of the talent pool, which has made it easier for companies to get the right talent. “So many people have left big cities like Bengaluru and are working from their hometowns. That is why companies are reaching out to these smaller places. For women, this is a particularly good opportunity. Firms can also negotiate a salary based on the living standards of the city. It is a win-win for both,” he says. Lokendra Sethi, HR head at DXC Technolog, agrees that WFH opens up more roles for women. Anshuman Ray, head of human resources at semiconductor tools company Synopsys, says they recently hired two mid-career women in Pune and Kolkata. “This would not have been done earlier, as we do not have a base location there. If we need innovation, it is a no brainer that we need more women, and the pandemic has given us a little bit of push in that direction. Why miss out on a wider talent pool which can contribute to the business?” he asks. We recently hired two mid-career women in Pune and Kolkata This would not have been done earlier, as we do not have a base location there - said by Anshuman Ray, director, human resources, Synopsys Synopsys has two programmes to take women back into its fold. One is called the Maternal Buddy programme, which handholds employees who are returning after a maternity break. The other, Reignite Your Aspirations (RYA), was started earlier this year, and tracks women who might have taken a sabbatical for some reason, and seeks to bring them back after some training. It has already helped bring some women back.\n",

While the percentage of women in these roles is lower than that of men, women are still employed in significant numbers within the industry.

However, it is important to note that there may still be instances of discrimination or bias in the hiring process, and continued efforts are needed to promote diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.\n",

There has been implicit preparation, in the form of education, experience, and ongoing continuous improvement, but no studying/cramming for the interview. The preparation for the interviews I’ve had has always been limited to showing up with the actual knowledge and experience I had gained prior to the interview. In other words, there was no last-minute, last-week, or last-month studying/cramming. I arrived at the interviews ready to discuss and demonstrate what I know, what I have done, what I can do, how well I can adapt and learn, how well I can communicate, and enough humility to accept that I don’t know everything and that there will always be new things to learn and there will always be room for improvement. I have never studied web sites or books containing technical interview questions/topics/answers. My performance in interviews has been based on the knowledge, skill, and experience I brought to the table at the time. I have never believed that studying/cramming for a technical interview was a good idea. The preparation should be the knowledge, skill, and experience you actually have prior to the interview, and not a set of questions/topics/answers you studied explicitly for the interview. Prior jobs, prior projects, prior education, and continuously working to hone your craft — this is the preparation that really counts.

Exposure - In your first job you want to get as much exposure as possible to core product management functions, types of products/technology, and functional teams the PMs tend to interact with (engineering, sales, marketing, finance, executive teams, client service, etc). This will give you great context for how things work in many different areas—a fantastic asset to have early in your PM career.Big companies tend to win in this category IF you get access to theContinue ReadingThere are three things you want to optimize for in your first PM job: exposure, mentorship and association with successful companies. Exposure - In your first job you want to get as much exposure as possible to core product management functions, types of products/technology, and functional teams the PMs tend to interact with (engineering, sales, marketing, finance, executive teams, client service, etc). This will give you great context for how things work in many different areas—a fantastic asset to have early in your PM career.Big companies tend to win in this category IF you get access to these different areas. Understanding how much you'll actually interact with these different areas is key. Even if your scope is somewhat narrow you still probably are better off in a bigger company.Small companies have fewer products and fewer people with deep specialization a, which doesn't allow you to learn how all the different functional areas fit together (an important trait for PMs). That said you'll probably have access to everyone in the company and have the opportunity to do tasks you'd never get in a big Co.Mentorship - This is the number one thing I'd optimize for your first PM role. How skillful and experienced is the person you'll be reporting to? Do they seem inclined to mentor you? In my career, this was the single biggest factor in my development as a PM and should be high on your list.I think big and small companies can be on level playing fields here. You really just need to get to know your prospective boss during the interview process and make a judgement call.One word of caution! Definitely avoid being the only product person in a small company as a junior PM. Product is a very nuanced role that requires a certain level of mastery before you’ll likely to succeed as a solo PM. I learned this one the hard way! :)Assocation with Successful Companies - While being associated with success doesn't mean you’re actually a better PM, it does affect the way others view you and your future opportunities. As irrational as the halo effect is—it is still very real.Big companies tend to have the advantage here since there is less risk of them failing.Startups on the other hand have the potential to both help or hurt your career on this particular issue—its just impossible to predict in the early stages. They’re probably not worth the extra risk for your first PM role unless you plan to spend your career working in startups anyways.A final consideration A lot depends on where you want to spend your career. If you want to be in small companies, then it may be worth taking your chances and joining a small company. That's actually what I did (despite the extra risk). If you think you might like bigger companies start there and you can always move down to a smaller company in the future. When I started out as a PM I interviewed with both big and small companies and evaluated each opportunity on its own merits. That approach worked really well for me.\n",
      "模型答案: It depends on what you want to focus on. Work at a small company if you want to get the product from 0 to 1 [1](i.e. find a product/market fit[2] and help conceive the first MVP(s)[3]) Work at a large one if you want to scale that product. Good luck.\n",

A good PM must sincerely understand the customers' pain points and deliver products or solutions that meet or hopefully exceeds their expectation. A great PM builds products that address pain points the customer hasn't even identified themselves.Critical thinking is the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue to form a judgment. A good PM remains objective when evaluating a situation and is often \"data-informed\" but not \"data-driven,\" as past behaviors may not predict how future customers will react. A great PM knows how to balance critical thinking and data insights with a touch of instinct to assess a situation and make decisions.Leadership is the action of leading a group of people or an organization. Although a PM does not usually have a large group of direct reports, they often lead and give direction to an extended team of developers, program managers, product designers, and many others. As a result, they must inspire a team they have no authority over to give their best to meet a deadline, deliver a product, and innovate. To do this, they need to be effective communicators, consistent with their actions and treat everyone with respect.\n",
      "模型答案: Product management is a skill you learn and improve through practice. The articles and books cited in the other answers are great for gaining perspective, but being a good product manager boils down to a few core practices.1. Be aware. This applies to everything: the product, your team, yourself. It's easy to get caught up with the details of a project and miss the big picture. It's also easy to get caught up in the routine you've established for you and your team and not realizing it's not working. Take a step back and observe your assumptions, your existing practices, and your performance; you'll be surprised what you'll realize. Some questions to ask:Is the product we're building solving the correct problem? Is it solving the problem correctly?How does this decision play out in the long term?What are the unintended consequences?How is the team doing? Are you optimizing too much for progress vs. team well-being?What areas do you need to develop to be a better leader?2. Be adaptable. In addition to being aware, you need to adapt to the new information. Products evolve, prototypes fail, and people's needs change. If the product isn't solving the right problem, change course. If a meeting is no longer productive, cancel\n",

      "模型答案: One, there is no balance. Take time off when you get it. And put full effort to doing and enjoying time off. Don’t be passively sitting in front of a screen. Make your time off count, be memorable, be an adventure. Work will at time just consume your life. Deadlines, hot projects, emergencies, etc. unless you have some dull, stable type of work. Managing stress.don’t fight reality. Try to find ways to relax and enjoy and even laugh at the chaos. In 100 years this stuff will not matter. Good enough for government work.When you are feeling tense: sit or stand at your tallest, shoulders back and breathe deeply 10 times.Focus on the work not on your feelings. And do not focus on the negatives. Focus on the possitives. Make some up if you must. Your mood witll go with your focus.Take care of your body…On breaks really take a break. Talk about your outside interests, not work. Read a good book. Make plans for after work or your next day off. You might be at work but on breaks and lunch your mind can go anywhere in the world other than work. Again something positive and enjoyable. Not nasty chores that need doing at home.M\n",

The next step is Generative AI (gen AI) , which has the ability to create new, original content. This has the potential to disrupt all industries, and push further what machines can do for us!\n",
      "模型答案: LLMs (Language Model Generative AI) are a type of generative AI that use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate new, original content. These models are trained on large amounts of data, including text, images, and other media, to learn patterns and relationships in the data. This allows them to generate new text, images, and other media based on the patterns they have learned. LLMs have the potential to disrupt various industries, including healthcare, finance, and marketing, as they can be used to automate tasks that were previously performed by humans. However, LLMs are not yet fully capable of creating art or literature on their own, and there are concerns about the impact these technologies may have on jobs in the creative arts.\n",

      "标准答案: As a female programmer, I cannot resist the temptation to answer (in a long rambling way). Some of the issues I have seen with women in programming are these: 1. Lack of role models. On the average you see very few female programmers who have stuck with it for more than 10 years. Given the small number, it is hard to find mentors/friends you want to hang out with and learn from.

Some of the issues I have seen with women in programming are these: 1. Lack of role models. On the average you see very few female programmers who have stuck with it for more than 10 years. Given the small number, it is hard to find mentors/friends you want to hang out with and learn from. The other important thing is, you want to have everything a great male programmer wants to have, plus what you were raised to aspire to have as a woman. These things are sometimes off on tangents, and that makes it hard to reconcile. 2. Being mentored out of programming. On the average a female programmer is usually better at being social than her male counterparts. This makes them more obvious targets, from a manager's perspective, to be groomed into managers or product managers. A common problem seems to be that most engineering managers of either gender have no idea how to manage women. So the women who get promoted to manage engineering teams pick up the same skills and tend to behave very much like the managers they had worked with in the past. 3. Not working on personal projects. Never in any of the personal (non-work, non-school) programming projects, have I ever worked with a female programmer. This is a very common thing to do with good male programmers. But very rarely done by women outside of school/work. And is pretty much the best way to improve your skills as a programmer. 4. Negative stereotyping. Let's say you get an intern for the summer. If it's a male programmer, the default assumption always is he is a good programmer and would be fine with setting up his own machine, RAID, whatnot. But a female programmer has to prove she can do each thing, before someone will accept that she can. This probably means, you will not get a \"harder\" problem to solve at the very beginning of your career. 5. Different motivations. Most of the exceptional male programmers I know are motivated by completely different things than the female programmers I know. Women tend to look at programming as a way to solve a certain problem - if the problem is interesting, they will work to get it done. Men, while being motivated by the problem also seem to enjoy the mechanics of how the program works. They are just as excited about additional L1 cache, a 13% performance/memory improvement or the number of pipelines in the latest graphics processor than women are. To understand this, look at the most successful startups started by women and the ones started by men. I have put together and pulled apart every bit of a computer at least a thousand times, at work. But I did not really go and buy parts to put together a PC at home. I bought a Macbook :P 6. Social Pressure. I will probably get yelled out of the forum for saying this. But, being a female programmer does not make you the most attractive thing in the universe. You have to be attractive despite the fact, if you are, at all. Wealth, social stature, etc., work wonders for a male programmer. If you are not socially accepted in high school, you can work really hard and make it as an ubergeek and the trappings that come along with it will make you attractive. Not really how it works for women. It is really cool to be hi-5ed for debugging something and being told \"You are the man!\". But the thrill of that gets old pretty soon. 7. Wanting to fit in with the female population in general. When you spend so much time in places that have less than 10% women, it warps your perspective of the world. Most female programmers have probably been in such a setting since they were in their teens (highschool, college, grad school, jobs etc). You tend to end up having way more male friends, and slowly stop doing things most women enjoy. You are militantly trying to be more ungirly than you are really comfortable with, at least for the first few years as a programmer. (On the flip side, this does make it really amazing to meet other female programmers.) I must also add: I got my first computer in 4th grade. Punched in BASIC to get pretty pixels on the screen etc. But that did not get me the kind of high some other people I know seemed to have gotten out of it. Also, I was raised in a culture where being geeky was not the worst thing in the world. But still, I did not I make up my mind to be a programmer until I was 17 - primarily motivated by Bill Gates, wanting to start a company. CS has the lowest barrier if you want to start your own business, compared to many other fields. The age of first exposure to programming is not such a big deal. I have met guys who pick up their first programming language at 18 and were doing amazing things with it in a year or two. To be clear, the internet, has changed everything. The way people learn to program and find friends. So a lot of things would be very different for a young girl starting out right now.\n",

In SaaS, that usually looks something like 5–10x revenue. And then you see these startups that are acquired at ridiculous multiples of revenue. Youtube is a particularly outrageous one—acquired at 1.65 BILLION revenues of only $15 million.That is what we like to call a strategic acquisition. (I promise I’ll get to the point here 😂) 100x revenue is an absolute head-in-the-clouds number. If any startup founder with 15m in revenue told you they want over a 100x multiplier on revenue, you’d laugh them out of town. But that’s what Youtube got. WAY more than they’re worth “on paper”. Google acquired Youtube on a basis of strategy, not revenue. They had a feeling Youtube was going to be huge. They weren’t wrong. Youtube brought in 15 billion in revenue in 2019. When it comes to joining a company, that’s what you want. You want to prove to the leadership team that’s hiring you that you’re a strategic hire. As soon as you let them put a formula on you, you’re done. For example… “We have this marketing position. We can get someone online to do these tasks for $30/hr, but we want someone in house. $30*40 hrs*52 is $62,400, so that is what we’re offering you”. That’s a number that’s tied to your hourly worth. You might be able to prove that you’re worth $40hr, but you’re still playing small. Here are a couple ways you can flip the game on it’s head:You have relevant, unique experience in the industry. Maybe you’ve even worked for the competition. Or you have some kind of insight in their space that would be extremely hard and rare to find. That makes you more of a unicorn.You can point to performance numbers that show how much upside you can create for the company. This is a value based pitch rather than an expense based pitch. You could show them exactly how you plan to do thisYou have assets that nobody else does—huge connections, a big social media following, etc—showing to the leadership team that you can “take them places” the second you are hired. You can help put them on the map.Now the actual negotiation here is tricky because the startup isn’t made of money. So how can you create the most possible upside for yourself? Get some skin in the game. Most startup people absolutely love this! It shows that you’re one of them. You’re a risk/reward player. It’s a solid move that lets you ask for more without breaking too much rapport.Ask for a plan that’s heavily incentive based. Remember the second bullet above about creating upside for the company? Well, if you can create X amount of money for the company, what would that be worth to them? It shows you’re confident you can perform, gives you some skin in the game, and significant upside if you can show up.Most startups are low on cash, but they can offset that with equity. Just make sure you ask a ton of questions about how exactly that equity works. They’ll like that you’re willing to take equity and there can still be strong upside in it for you.A lot of these strategies are things I’ve worked on personally to help create a win/win with the different startups I’ve worked in.

      "标准答案: Here is the five-step process if you want to get your first job into a product management role (this is valid for freshers looking for their first job or people who want to transition from tech, marketing, sales, etc. to product manager role). But first, let me tell you what you shouldn’t do: “Do not rely on applying through job portals such as Linkedin, Naukri, AngelList, etc, and expecting HRs to call you. There are hundreds of people applying for the same role, so HRs use many biased filters such as college, years of experience, brand names etc. to reduce the number of candidates for the roleContinue ReadingHere is the five-step process if you want to get your first job into a product management role (this is valid for freshers looking for their first job or people who want to transition from tech, marketing, sales, etc. to product manager role). But first, let me tell you what you shouldn’t do: “Do not rely on applying through job portals such as Linkedin, Naukri, AngelList, etc, and expecting HRs to call you. There are hundreds of people applying for the same role, so HRs use many biased filters such as college, years of experience, brand names etc. to reduce the number of candidates for the role. If you are a fresher, chances are you will likely be filtered out here only.” The product management roles have become very popular these days, hence you will face a lot of competition while searching for the first job. Now coming to the 5 steps to get your first job as a product manager: Step 1: Learn product management: Yes if you do not have knowledge of the fundamental skills of a product manager then no company would want to hire you. Have a good understanding of user research, execution, wireframing, problem-solving, and communication. You can follow a structured course or curriculum to crack this, it should take you around 2 months to do this well. (You’ll be ahead of 80% of candidates if you do this well) Step 2: Choose the industry you want to work in: Based on your educational background, work experience, or interest, pin-point a sector to work on. It could be ed-tech, fin-tech, food-tech, health-tech, SAAS, crypto, or anything. Do thorough research of all the happenings of this industry, you can use a framework such as a porter 5 forces to do this (you’ll study such frameworks in Step 1). Step 3: Make a list of about 20 companies in that sector where you would want to work: You can find these companies via quick google search, LinkedIn, naukri.com, angel list, etc. It will be much better if these companies are mid-sized so that you can reach out to decision-makers directly via email. Step 4: Add value: Suppose that you were a product manager at these companies, how would you help them in your first three months? Do a product tear down, do some user research, add market research, and build a solid case of how you can add value to the product. Create a well-written guide or presentation (If you could create MVPs that would be much better.). (Do DM me if you need a template/idea of what to create). Put all your efforts and learning here. If you have done Steps 1 and 2 wholeheartedly then you will do a great job in this step. Step 5: Reach out to the company’s decision-makers with your analysis: Now find emails of decision-makers in the company (CEO, CPO, CTO, etc.) and send them your analysis (Done in Step 4) along with a good introduction and why you are passionate about working with them. Step 6: Repeat for other companies: Now follow up with these people up to three times (because busy people can actually miss things), and iterate this process to other companies in the list. I can assure you that if you put in enough efforts, you are likely to get replies from many of them. Why this method works? This method works because in your analysis you will showcase all of the skills that a product manager is supposed to have (which cannot be assured from a resume), this will reduce the risk of a wrong hire. This will also get you a good understanding of the industry which is a very important thing people look for in product managers. This indicates that you are a self-starter and take ownership (you did analysis by yourself and reached out to them), which again is a must-have skill for product management roles. This indicates that you are actually passionate about working at the company as you might have invested so many hours in doing the analysis.This method is proven to be successful but I am sure less than 1% of aspiring product managers are going to go through this (because it's a lot of hard work). I hope this will help you get your first job as a product manager. In case you need any help or advice, messaging me is never a bad idea. You can find me on LinkedIn here. Thanks.\n",

FAANG company culture can be more dynamic and entertaining than working with “boring old banks”. There is also a lot of hype around FAANG that projects an image developers desire. In other words, FAANG markets themselves in a way developers like. Once you work with either of these kinds of companies, your perspective may change. As a consultant, I’ve had a wide array of experience in this space. Whenever I work with Amazon, it is always an extreme…. it’s either a wonderful experience or miserable. They have, hands-down, one of the worst cultures I’ve worked in. They also have one of the top 10 best. These companies are large enough to have multiple cultures. The employees are always motivated to do things very well though, even in the stressful work environments. The financial services industry is very different. I’ve been lucky enough to work with several clients building new financial products, and they often have the same enthusiasm for development (and compensation). However; more of the experiences are pretty humdrum. There’s a job. You do it. There’s no fanfare around it and people continue about their day… because that’s how the business operates. Many of the employees I see at these companies have been there for 20+yrs, because they’re tired and want stability. I see more of that as developers get older and have more life responsibilities. In my experience, the financial service clients have always had a better work-life balance. The FAANG companies are the ones I use in my sales pitches though. When an employee moves on, they use their experience as a personal sales pitch in their interviews. There is another similar reason some developers want to be a part of FAANG. Some developers want to start their own business. FAANG companies have a huge marketing engine that promotes individual developers, and some even have VC that backs former employees. Ever notice how the people on Twitter or Quora who worked at these companies typically have higher follower counts? It’s easier to gain an audience when a FAANG company retweets you to their mega-audience. That’s called piggybacking to build an audience. It was an early entrepreneurial success strategy. These days, I find that to be a tired approach, but it still resonates with a lot of developers. The point in all this is that FAANG employment resonates with the lifestyle and goals many people have. Banks do too, but people who pursue those lifestyles tend to be more reserved/quiet compared to those seeking FAANG lifestyles. That’s why you hear so little about these roles.\n",

The experience is fundamentally different.The team you're working with. Yahoo has outstanding teams as well as mediocre ones. The best teams are working on the most strategic products.I will share my experience here (with removing any proprietary information). Currently I am a product manager on an iOS/Android app. So here's how my days look like: Research what's out there in the market. Keep an eye on the competitors; what they are doing and what they are expected to do. I do that through quick competitive analysis studies that I perform on regular basis. I use a simple competitor array to make sure i do that quickly. Check the template on Wikipedia under Competitor analysis. Conduct persona creation sessions to forge our target audience and their behaviors I invite a lot of people from different departments to participate in those sessions. It always helps to get fresh ideas from non-technical people. Create user stories based on the persona created. Prioritize user stories according to what makes sense for the user. Iteration is in the core of what we do. The small agile team is always involved in the very details of the product. Sometimes we iterate on an icon design 10 times or more. This process is very informal and very rapid. I work very closely with engineers, designers and testers. We literally sit in the very same area with no borders or walls.I do NOT have solid set requirements when development starts.I realized it's a bad idea if you want to go agile. When we start development our requirements is a collection of user stories, story boards, paper prototypes and whiteboards, where the details can change at any moment. This is actually inexpensive and works very well when you have a small team (3-5 people) setting closely together. This doesn't mean changing the overall scope often. Only the details change. Requirements evolve during development. Every morning, and during the daily SCRUM (which doesn't take more than 20 minutes), we discuss what we did yesterday, what we'll do today and if there any impediments. My job is to remove those impediments. Then I start drawing user flaws in a huge white board that's physically next to our cube. Anybody in the agile team is encouraged to give their opinion about the user flow and the details of UX. This takes usually 15 to 30 minutes. Then we start implementing. This feedback process doesn't stop, we discuss every single detail as it's being built. This can be distracting, but the benefits over-weighs the drawbacks.It's not only the SCRUM team who needs to be involved here. I continuously communicate with other stakeholders like sales, marketing, biz dev, PR, legal and senior management, and make sure I collect their requirements.To make sure that all stakeholders are aware of what's going on, I conduct weekly/monthly product demos where i showcase the current progress and what will be accomplished next week. It's extremely important for stakeholders to be aware of what you're doing. This is how you get their buy-in. Which is crucial when you're building a new product. During development and on daily-basis, I write requirements for the team, make sure they have all the artifacts they need. Sometimes write pieces of code that will accelerate their work. An example of that will be that a developer needs a list of images IDs that are stored in an excel file. You need to strip those IDs and covert then to CSV file for him. You need to do a lot of house-cleaning so your SCRUM team doesn't stop. Anything that keeps the flow going. And if you find yourself free (which rarely happen), I do some bug fixing. Not freaking out: I am adding this as a daily activity simply because it's an essential part of what you do: You'll be bombarded with ideas and suggestions from people in the org and from users, trying to give you 'awesome' ideas on how to make the product better or how to quickly monetize it. Your role is calm down, absorb these suggestions, think them through and filter only the meaningful ones. While keeping everybody happy.Make sure that the team is focused on the high-level scope. I do that through stressing that every single day, minimizing the number of meetings as much as possible, and block external noise. This is paramount to be able to deliver on time.Check out the code on your machine and test like crazy. Test, test and test.Keep a relentless attention to details. The more details you know, and the more technical you're involved in the product, the better. Unfortunately, as a product manager, there's no threshold to how deep you go in the details on all levels: code, UX, SEO, QE ...etc. Developers will always welcome you being involved in what they do, but by doing that, make sure you know your technical limits too and respect their aptitude. Live and breath the product. Use the product all the time. Always keep a note next to you when you discover bugs or an idea for a feature pops. I use Evernote wherever i go. Motivating the team: keep your team motivated through explaining to them why we're doing what we're doing. Get them excited for the product. This is how you get the best out of them. Do users interviews on monthly basis. You will be surprised how users will use your product. After proving that the product you created is being used, establish a growth trajectory for the product. This involves many activities: working with marketing, business development and PR. Define what type of growth activity is will get you the maximum ROI: sticky, viral or paid. Focusing on metrics that really matter. For a mobile app for example, this can be active users/day, minutes spent/active users and weekly retention rate. Everything else does not really matter. Continuously learning stuff: I went to electrical engineering school, so you guessed it right: I have a lot of catch up to do. I use: http://www.udacity.com/ and https://www.coursera.org/.Do your team's laundry if necessary :)\n",

For getting selected into Deloitte, either show very good portfolio of technical knowledge directly coming from IT industry or else show a good portfolio of extra curricular activities by presenting yourself in a very decent manner. Let me tell you the selection process: 1. Written In written test, you have 5sections (English, Maths, Reasoning, SQL, C-coding). For clearing the test, you just require basic mathematics up to 10th standard. Reasoning questions are mostly from arrangements in different manners and sequences. For SQL, I would suggest going through the extreme cases (NULL statements), transactions, etc. Refer Ivan Bayross if you want to learn SQL. C coding involves two questions: 20marks and 40marks respectively. One question is for creating a pattern and another examines the arrays and pointers logics. 2. Group Case Study The case studies are usually from the situations where data maintenance is a problem and for it you should just keep points in a well planned manner and with references to upcoming technologies in market. Believe me, don’t take names of extreme technologies that are not required for the situation. Some people just know a word Hadoop and they start saying this everywhere even where handling of big data is not required. Analyze the case properly and then build your points. It is usually of 7–10 minutes and in this 7mins are for discussion and 3mins for giving presentation on sheets that will be provided to you. I got this case study, ” There is a company running 3 atomic energy plants but their reporting tool takes a long time. Apart from this, the data is not centralized.

For clearing the test, you just require basic mathematics up to 10th standard. Reasoning questions are mostly from arrangements in different manners and sequences. For SQL, I would suggest going through the extreme cases (NULL statements), transactions, etc. Refer Ivan Bayross if you want to learn SQL. C coding involves two questions: 20marks and 40marks respectively. One question is for creating a pattern and another examines the arrays and pointers logics. 2. Group Case Study The\n",

Back in the days, researchers and professors did not code as much because they had students to do it for them. Its important that your candidate understands coding and can demonstrate it through previous projects or a coding exercise.Machine learning and NLP classes. If you are looking at a fresh grad, make sure that they have taken one or more of the following classes: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Text Mining and Information Retrieval and Data Mining.A Degree preferably in a computational field. I think this is important although can be replaced with significant work experience in the field. You need to have fairly solid math, algorithms and critical thinking skills to be able successfully analyze all that unstructured data and build models for real business problems. That usually comes with bachelors level education and higher.Watch Out for (red flag! red flag!):Deep Learning Experts without any of the above qualities.0 relevant projects to point to0 experience with text, but lots with images. There needs to be a shift in thinking for an image person to start making progress with text. There is a learning curve, and I personally believe its steep. It took me years to get to a place where text mining and NLP are just second nature to me. Now, if you ask me to start working with images, its going to take me a while!Word count projects - while counting words is a very basic form of text mining, it should not be weighed heavily as NLP experience.\n",

      "问题: What are the best and efficient ways to learn algorithms for beginners?\n",
      "标准答案: To answer your question in the most effective way possible, I would say that there isn’t any easy way to learn algorithms. However there are efficient methods in which you can learn them and if you can put in that effort, it will slowly start feeling easy for you. So to come to your question- the efficient ways to learn DSA mainly depend on these factors mentioned below:The prior knowledge you have about the topics of DSAThe ultimate goal which you want to achieve by learning DSAResources that are available and which you can useGuides for helping you throughout the wayNow let's look into what IContinue ReadingTo answer your question in the most effective way possible, I would say that there isn’t any easy way to learn algorithms. However there are efficient methods in which you can learn them and if you can put in that effort, it will slowly start feeling easy for you. So to come to your question- the efficient ways to learn DSA mainly depend on these factors mentioned below:The prior knowledge you have about the topics of DSAThe ultimate goal which you want to achieve by learning DSAResources that are available and which you can useGuides for helping you throughout the wayNow let's look into what I meant by each of these points:Prior knowledge of DSA:Do you already know the basics of DSA? Are you well versed with basic data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, etc and can you implement Searching and Sorting algorithms? If your answers to these questions are yes, then yes you can easily learn the subject in detail and you won’t be taking much time as a newbie would need. Now if your answer is no then you have a long way to go to grasp the basics first and then dive into more complicated details. 2. Goal to achieve by learning DS and Algorithms: Now to figure out how deep you must delve into the subject you first need to have your goals clear. Some people learn DSA for acing programming interviews, some for winning competitive coding competitions and few do it just to increase their knowledge in this area.If you are learning DSA for cracking job exams or interviews, you need to learn a few selected sets of data structures that are generally asked in interviews and focus on them for scoring well.If you are preparing for competitive coding, then you will have to build your knowledge in complex data structures which includes Binary Indexed trees, segment trees, and Fenwick trees.Now if you are just learning to enhance your knowledge there is no dearth of things to learn on this topic, so you can start with the basics and go into the complex ones.3. Resources available: There are multiple books which are present on this subject which you can refer to. Let me tell you some books which I followed while I prepared for DSA:Algorithms Unlocked- Thomas CoremanAlgorithmic puzzles- Anany and Maria LevitinMathematics for Computer Science- by MIT open courseware4. Guidance: Now you have an idea about how you can learn DSA and why you are learning it. Also, you have an idea about the books you can refer to for learning the subject. Now you need to figure out a guide - an institute, an online course, or mentors to help you learn the topics well or progress in your career. There are many options out there- multiple online courses or online institutes you can learn DSA from. But I would suggest you check out such an institute which would not only teach you the topics well but would also give you sufficient career guidance if you need so at the moment. After checking out many institutes I found such an institute that would help you in the whole process- from teaching the topics, to helping you prepare for interviews and build your resume. The institute’s name is Tutort Academy. They offer 1:1 doubt clearing sessions, live interactive sessions, mock interviews, and resume building sessions which would help you out especially if you are a working professional looking for a change in your career. Especially if you are targetting to land a job in a top-tier MNC, this institute would help you achieve that goal.\n",
      "模型答案: assistance with your resume and interview preparation. Also, it has a dedicated support team that can answer all your queries. Now I think you have an idea about the institute, and the course it offers. So, I would recommend you to check out the Tutort Academy, and I hope you will find it helpful. Hope this helps! \n",
      "Q: What are the best and efficient ways to learn algorithms for beginners?\n",
      "A: What is algorithms An algorithm is a set of instructions that provides a way to solve a problem or achieve a goal. It is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a task. An algorithm is composed of a finite number of steps that must be followed in a specific order. The algorithm should be complete, accurate, and unambiguous so that it can be followed by a computer or a person. Algorithms can be written in any programming language and can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as sorting lists, searching databases, calculating mathematical equations, and more. Algorithms are used in all areas of computer science, from artificial intelligence to operating systems.The efficient ways to learn DSA mainly depend on these factors mentioned below: 1. Start with the fundamentals. Learn basic concepts such as sorting, searching, graphs, and data structures.\n",
