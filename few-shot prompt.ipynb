In fact, research suggests that employees who stay longer tend to experience higher job satisfaction. As a software engineer, focus on building meaningful relationships, developing new skills, and finding a workplace environment that aligns with your values and interests.

    "\n",
    "Student: Iâ€™m not sure what career suits me. Any advice?  \n",
    "Chatbot: Thatâ€™s a common concern. You might want to try some career interest assessments to learn more about your strengths and preferences. Attending career talks and workshops can also help. If you want, I can help you book a session with a career counselor for deeper guidance.\n",

    "Student: I feel anxious about my future and donâ€™t know what to do.  \n",
